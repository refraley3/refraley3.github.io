## *Genus species*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [FamilyName](/field-notes/lichen/family/familyname/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**COMMON NAME**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-name/) (*Genus species*) is a brief, orienting overview that establishes
what the species is, why it is distinctive, and where it is typically encountered.
This paragraph should be readable without prior lichen knowledge.

For representative images and visual context, see the page: [**COMMON NAME**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-name/) in the **Gallery** section.


## Description

*Genus species* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** foliose / fruticose / crustose  
- **Thallus:** color, thickness, texture  
- **Lobes:** width, shape, margins (if applicable)  
- **Surface features:** soredia / isidia / pseudocyphellae (as applicable)  
- **Underside:** color, presence or absence of rhizines  
- **Attachment:** loose / firm / tightly appressed  

Include general growth pattern and typical substrate preferences.  
Avoid comparative diagnostics in this section.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typical substrates and settings include:
- Bark (note tree types if known)
- Rock (calcareous vs. siliceous, if relevant)
- Soil, decaying wood, moss, etc.

Notes may include:
- Light exposure
- Moisture
- Community context (isolated vs. mixed growth)

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:**  
- **Form:**  
- **Surface:**  
- **Underside:**  
- **Reproductive structures:**  
- **Chemistry:** (if applicable, e.g., K test)

This is the **diagnostic core** of the page.

Include:
- Field marks that separate this species from close lookalikes
- Notes on commonly confused species (by name)

This section may reference:
- Attachment (rhizines vs. bare)
- Underside characters
- Consistency across multiple observations

## Ecology and Notes

Use this section for:
- Ecological role
- Indicator value (air quality, nitrogen, disturbance)
- Seasonal behavior
- Frequency or distribution notes in REGION

This is also an appropriate place to mention:
- Research Grade confirmation
- iNaturalist trends, if relevant
