## FAMILY NAME

**FAMILY NAME** is a family of primarily **GROWTH FORM** lichens, recognized by **key diagnostic traits** and commonly found on **typical substrates**. Members of this family occur in **general habitat types** and play an important role in lichen communities.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is typically **crustose / foliose / fruticose / squamulose**, varying from **texture or structure details**. It may be **areolate, rimose, smooth, granular**, or **lobed**, depending on genus and species. Colors commonly include **dominant color range**, often influenced by secondary chemistry and exposure.

### Substrate and Habitat

Species in this family grow on **rock, bark, wood, soil, or mixed substrates**, favoring **exposure level and habitat type** such as forests, open rock, alpine areas, or disturbed sites. Distribution is **widespread / regional / habitat-specific**, depending on the group.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia** (or other genus, if applicable).

### Reproductive Structures

Sexual reproduction is **common / occasional / rare**, and reproductive structures are often useful for identification.

- **Apothecia:** **lecanorine / lecideine / biatorine**, describing color, margin, and placement (e.g., sunken, sessile, prominent).
- **Asci:** Typically contain **number of spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** **simple / septate / muriform**, colorless or pigmented, shape description.

Asexual structures such as **soredia, isidia, or blastidia** may be **common / occasional / absent** and are often important field characters.

### Chemistry

Secondary metabolites are **common / variable / limited**, and spot tests are **diagnostic / variable / often weak**. Notable compounds include **compound names or pigment types**, which may influence thallus color.

### Ecology and Role

Members of this family are **ecological role** (e.g., pioneer species, forest indicators, stress-tolerant taxa). They contribute to **processes such as rock weathering, nutrient cycling, or habitat formation** and may indicate **environmental conditions**.

### Representative Genera

- **Genus name** – brief identifying note  
- **Genus name** – brief identifying note  

### Similar Lichen Families

FAMILY NAME may be confused with other lichen families with **similar growth forms or coloration**. **Similar Family 1** differs in **key distinguishing feature**. **Similar Family 2** can be separated by **spore type, apothecial structure, or chemistry**. **Similar Family 3** often differs in **substrate preference or reproductive traits**.
