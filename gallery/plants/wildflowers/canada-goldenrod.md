In the soft morning light of late autumn, this Canada goldenrod (*Solidago canadensis*)** rises above the fading grasses. Its once-bright yellow blooms have turned to pale seed tufts, ready to drift on the wind. Even as frost gathers at its base, the stem holds upright — a quiet testament to endurance in the changing seasons.
