### Identification
Dame’s Rocket is often mistaken for native phlox but can be distinguished by its **four-petaled flowers** and slightly toothed **lance-shaped leaves** arranged alternately along a hairy stem. The blossoms open from clustered buds that shift from pale pink to lavender or white. Each flower forms a slender seedpod typical of the mustard family.

### Ecology
This biennial or short-lived perennial readily naturalizes in disturbed areas, sometimes forming dense colonies. Though introduced, it provides early nectar for bees, butterflies, and moths.

_Clusters of pale blossoms attract pollinators—and small hunters alike._  
Four-petaled flowers in white and lavender rise above early-summer foliage, drawing bees and butterflies. Hidden among the blooms, a juvenile [**Black-and-Yellow Garden Spider**](/gallery/animals/arachnids/garden-spider/) waits for its chance among the nectar seekers.

**Observation:**  
Dame’s Rocket thrives where sun meets shade and soil stays moist. Its blooms glow at twilight, releasing a faint fragrance that gave rise to its name—_“Dame’s Rocket”_, for the evening perfume noticed by Victorian gardeners.
