**Black-eyed Susan in Minnesota grassland**  
The Black-eyed Susan stands among summer grasses, its golden rays unfurling from a dark central cone. A native wildflower of North America, it thrives in open prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soil — a symbol of resilience and renewal.

_A flower halfway to full radiance._  
The petals curve gently backward as they open, revealing the dark, raised cone that gives the species its name. A favorite of bees and butterflies, it’s both nectar source and midwestern icon.

Each blossom faces the sun, its yellow petals surrounding a seed-rich core soon to darken with maturity. Together, they define the midwestern meadow’s summer palette.

### Field Story

The first Black-eyed Susan of the season opened at the edge of a restored prairie — one blossom rising beside a dozen buds still curled tight. The bright yellow rays, still partly furled, echoed the energy of a landscape waking into midsummer.

The emerging petals glow gold against the green backdrop. As the bud unfurls, the cone begins to darken — a transformation as brief as the prairie’s summer itself. • Size: 4804×3203

## Observations

- **Color:** Bright yellow petals, dark brown to purplish-black center cone  
- **Texture:** Stems and leaves covered with short, stiff hairs  
- **Bloom Duration:** Long-lasting; individual flowers remain open for weeks  
- **Pollinators:** Attracts bees, butterflies, and hoverflies  
- **Seed Head:** Retains shape into autumn, providing food for finches  

### Seed Head

After blooming, the ray petals fall away, leaving a seed-filled cone that darkens and hardens through late summer. Goldfinches and other seed-eaters visit long after the color has faded.
