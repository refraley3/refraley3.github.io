## Trees

This gallery explores the diversity of North American trees — from sunlit birch groves and sugar maples to red pine plantations and alpine firs. Each species reveals a strategy for survival: thick bark against fire, flexible trunks against wind, or leaves timed to the rhythm of light and frost.  

Here, the changing forms of bark, branch, and leaf trace the story of the continent’s forests.

_The architecture of light and air._  
A stillness between order and wildness, where the human hand fades into the forest’s design.

**Conifers**  
_The architecture of light and air._  
Their trunks and canopies define the woodland — steady, sheltering, and ever-changing through the seasons.

[![Leaves and Fruit of a Red Pine](/gallery/plants/trees/assets/red-pine/E21A6945.jpg){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Leaves and Fruit of a Red Pine"}  
**Deciduous**  
_Paired needles and small cones along a sunlit branch_  
Long, flexible needles grow in pairs, their soft green color catching the light beside the season’s cones. Each cone is modest—oval, unarmed, and built for simplicity—yet together they define the quiet geometry of a Red Pine in summer.

_Threads through the understory._
