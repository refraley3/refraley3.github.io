## Trees

This gallery explores the diversity of North American trees — from sunlit birch groves and sugar maples to red pine plantations and alpine firs. Each species reveals a strategy for survival: thick bark against fire, flexible trunks against wind, or leaves timed to the rhythm of light and frost.  

Here, the changing forms of bark, branch, and leaf trace the story of the continent’s forests.

_The architecture of light and air._  
A stillness between order and wildness, where the human hand fades into the forest’s design.
