## Description

The **Red Pine**, also known as the **Norway Pine**, is Minnesota’s state tree and a defining species of northern forests. Its tall, straight trunks and reddish bark make it one of the most recognizable conifers in the Great Lakes region.  
Tall trunks rise evenly from a carpet of needles, their bark shifting from gray at the base to a warm reddish tone in the light. Inside the stand, the forest floor is carpeted with needles and little undergrowth. Their wood is strong, light, and used for construction, utility poles, and pulpwood. Red Pines can be identified by their **Growth pattern**: Typically forms **straight, uniform stands**, especially in reforested areas.  

Red Pines are often planted for:
- **Reforestation** and **timber production**
- **Windbreaks**
- **Wildlife habitat restoration**

**Red Pine Needles and Cones**  
_Pairs of long needles and small, rounded cones characteristic of Red Pine._  
Long (4–6 inches) needles, flexible, and found in **pairs**. When bent, they **snap cleanly**—a classic field test.

## Forest Floor

Beneath the Red Pines, the forest floor gathers a soft mat of needles — a quiet habitat where fungi and insects share the filtered light. Among them, small brown mushrooms appear after rain, their caps fading as the days pass.
