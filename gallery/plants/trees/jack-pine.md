Jack Pines are resilient northern conifers adapted to fire and poor soils. Their cones remain sealed for years, opening only in the heat of a wildfire to release new seeds.

## Description

The **Jack Pine** thrives in sandy, acidic soils and regenerates after fire. Its irregular form and tightly closed cones make it a symbol of boreal resilience.

Jack Pines can be identified by their:
- **Growth pattern**: Often **crooked** or leaning, with sparse crowns.
- **Needles**: In **pairs**, short (1–2 inches), and slightly **twisted**.
- **Cones**: Small, **curved**, and resin-sealed until heated by fire.

### Range

Widespread across the **northern U.S. and Canada**, from **Minnesota and Michigan** to the **Atlantic coast**.

### Bark

- Thin, **gray-brown**, and scaly.  
- Provides little protection from fire, but the cones’ adaptation ensures survival.

### Leaves

- Short, **twisted pairs of needles** with a dull green color.

### Fruit

- **Cones**: Curved and asymmetrical, often pointing forward along branches.

## Habitat

Jack Pines thrive in:
- **Sandy or glacial soils**
- **Open, sunny environments**
- **Fire-dependent ecosystems**
