**Lodgepole Pine Branch and Cones**  
_Slender needles and persistent cones mark this narrow-crowned mountain pine._  
Pairs of fine, straight needles cluster densely around small, egg-shaped cones that cling for several seasons — a trait of this fire-adapted species. • Size: 6720×4480

## Description

The **Lodgepole Pine** is a slender, straight-trunked conifer native to the western mountains of North America. Though best known from the Rockies and Pacific Northwest, it is occasionally planted in the upper Midwest for research plots, soil restoration, windbreaks, and ornamental use.

Its narrow crown and fine, paired needles set it apart from the heavier foliage of Red or Jack Pine.

Lodgepole Pines can be identified by their:

- **Needles:** 1.5–3 inches long, in **pairs**, fine and often straight  
- **Cones:** Small, egg-shaped, and **persistent**, sometimes remaining closed for years  
- **Growth habit:** A tall, narrow crown with closely spaced branches in youth

### Range

Native to the **western United States and Canada**, including the Rockies, Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and interior British Columbia.  
Outside its home range, it appears in **experimental forests, conservation plantings, arboretums, and occasionally private landscapes**.

### Bark

Thin, scaly, and gray-brown — offering little insulation from fire, which is why the species relies on its cones rather than thick bark for post-fire regeneration.
