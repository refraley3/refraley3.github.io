## Pines and Firs
{:.text-center}

---

From the windswept ridges of the Rockies to the glacial sands of the Great Lakes, these trees define the character of northern and western forests.  
Each species tells a story of adaptation — to fire, frost, wind, or elevation — and reflects the quiet endurance of life in harsh environments.

Explore the subtle differences in bark, cone, and needle that distinguish one pine from another, and the landscapes they shape.

**Red Pine (*Pinus resinosa*)**  
_Minnesota’s state tree._  
Tall, straight trunks and paired needles define the Red Pine, a species common in northern forests and reforestation areas. Its reddish bark and soft green color make it a standout of the pine family.

**Jack Pine (*Pinus banksiana*)**  
_Resilient and fire-adapted._  
A hardy northern species with curved cones that open only after fire. Jack Pines thrive on sandy soils and help regenerate boreal forests after disturbance.

**Douglas Fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*)**  
_The towering evergreen of the Pacific Northwest._  
Not a true fir, the Douglas Fir is prized for its height and strong timber. Its distinctive cones, each with “mouse-tail” bracts, are a key identifying feature.
