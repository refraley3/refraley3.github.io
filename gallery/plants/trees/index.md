## Pines and Firs
{:.text-center}

---

From the windswept ridges of the Rockies to the glacial sands of the Great Lakes, these trees define the character of northern and western forests.  
Each species tells a story of adaptation — to fire, frost, wind, or elevation — and reflects the quiet endurance of life in harsh environments.

Explore the subtle differences in bark, cone, and needle that distinguish one pine from another, and the landscapes they shape.

[![Red Pine](/gallery/plants/trees/assets/red-pine/E21A6955.jpg){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Red Pine"}  
**Red Pine (*Pinus resinosa*)**  
_Minnesota’s state tree._  
Tall, straight trunks and paired needles define the Red Pine, a species common in northern forests and reforestation areas. Its reddish bark and soft green color make it a standout of the pine family.

**Whitebark Pine (*Pinus albicaulis*)**  
_A high-altitude survivor._  
Found near alpine treelines, the Whitebark Pine endures cold and wind. Its twisted form and symbiotic relationship with Clark’s nutcracker define mountain ecosystems of the West.

[![Jack Pine placeholder](/assets/images/under-construction_wht.png){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Jack Pine" style="width: 300px;"}  
**Jack Pine (*Pinus banksiana*)**  
_Resilient and fire-adapted._  
A hardy northern species with curved cones that open only after fire. Jack Pines thrive on sandy soils and help regenerate boreal forests after disturbance.

[![Douglas Fir placeholder](/assets/images/under-construction_wht.png){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Douglas Fir" style="width: 300px;"}  
**Douglas Fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*)**  
_The towering evergreen of the Pacific Northwest._  
Not a true fir, the Douglas Fir is prized for its height and strong timber. Its distinctive cones, each with “mouse-tail” bracts, are a key identifying feature.

[![Austrian Pine in Open Meadow](/gallery/plants/trees/assets/austrian-pine/E21A7573.jpg){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Austrian Pine"}  
**Austrian Pine in Open Meadow**  
_A broad, dark crown built for wind and open ground._  
Stiff paired needles and thick-scaled cones mark this European pine, long planted in the Midwest for windbreaks, durability, and its heavy, storm-resistant form.
