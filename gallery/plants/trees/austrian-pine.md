## Description

The **Austrian Pine** (also called **Black Pine**) is a rugged, mid-sized conifer native to central and southern Europe but widely planted across the upper Midwest. Known for its **long, stiff needles**, **dense branching**, and **dark, rounded crown**, it is a common choice for windbreaks, old farmstead plantings, and landscape screens.

Its overall form is heavier and more compact than the airy structure of Red Pine or the narrow shape of Jack Pine.

### Key Identification Traits

- **Needles:**  
  - In **pairs (2)**  
  - **4–6 inches** long  
  - Stiff, straight, often darker than Red Pine

- **Cones:**  
  - Oval, 2–3 inches  
  - Ripen to **pale brown**  
  - Occur in dense clusters on older branches

- **Habit:**  
  - A **broad, rounded crown**  
  - Dense, spreading lower limbs  
  - Heavy branching reaching the ground in younger trees

## Crown

Austrian Pines develop a **full, rounded crown** rather than the narrow, conical form of native Red Pine. The upper branches flare outward, creating a silhouette that appears **storm-resistant and muscular**.

The crown broadens early in life, producing a layered form that remains dense even in winter.

## Trunk

The trunk of an Austrian Pine is **gray-brown**, covered in **small, rough, scaly plates** that darken with age. It lacks the orange flaking of Red Pine and instead forms a muted, armor-like surface.

As the canopy thickens, shaded limbs create a tangle of twigs around the trunk, giving young and mid-aged trees their distinctive, rugged silhouette. Older individuals may show deeper furrowing, but the bark remains **dark, blocky, and coarse**, a hallmark of the species.

The bark forms tight, irregular plates—tougher and darker than that of Red Pine, and often covered by a shadowed tangle of persistent branches.

### Bark

The lower trunk of the Austrian Pine is coated in **dark gray-brown bark** broken into **small, rough, irregular plates**. Unlike Red Pine, which develops broad orange plates as it matures, Austrian Pine retains its **deep, muted coloration** throughout life. The bark appears almost armored, with tight fissures and scaly textures that contrast with the dense needles above.

## Leaves

- **Needles stiff and straight**, in bundles of two  
- Typically **dark green**, holding color through winter  
- Sharp to the touch  
- Densely clustered, often obscuring the branch structure

## Cones

Unlike the serotinous cones of Lodgepole Pine, Austrian Pine cones **open normally without fire** and drop within a few seasons. They grow in tight clusters that wrap around older branch wood.

- 2–3 inches long  
- Thick, blunt-tipped scales  
- Occur in clusters on mature wood  
- Ripen to a warm, pale brown

## Habitat

Although native to Europe, Austrian Pine thrives in the Upper Midwest’s:

- **Dry to moderately moist soils**  
- **Open, wind-exposed grasslands**  
- **County parks, road edges, and farm windbreaks**  
- **Poor sandy or gravelly soils** where few other pines persist  

Its durability explains why it commonly appears in restoration areas, field margins, and experimental plantings.
