## Description

**American Bittersweet** is a hardy, native climbing vine known for its striking late-season fruit.  
In autumn, its orange capsules peel open to reveal scarlet seeds that persist well into winter, providing important color — and wildlife forage — when the landscape becomes subdued.

It climbs by **twining** around nearby stems and branches, sometimes forming dense, sculptural tangles.  
Unlike the invasive **Oriental Bittersweet (*Celastrus orbiculatus*)**, the American species typically bears fruit at the **tips of the vines** rather than along the entire stem.
