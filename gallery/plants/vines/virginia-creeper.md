## Description

The **Virginia Creeper** is one of the most widespread native vines of eastern North America.  
It climbs by **tendrils**, not by rootlets, distinguishing it from poison ivy.  
In autumn, its leaves ignite into scarlet, copper, and wine-red hues, draping tree trunks and fences in color before the canopy above begins to fade.
