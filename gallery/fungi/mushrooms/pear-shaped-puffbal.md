## Overview

The pear-shaped puffball (*Lycoperdon pyriforme*) is a small woodland fungus found on decaying wood or moss-covered surfaces. Despite sometimes appearing to grow from living trees, it feeds only on decomposing organic matter, helping recycle nutrients in forest ecosystems.

## Appearance

* **Shape:** Rounded or slightly pear-shaped, typically 1â€“3 cm in diameter.
* **Color:** White when young, gradually turning tan or brown as it matures.
* **Surface:** Covered in small warty spines that wear off over time, leaving a dotted pattern.
* **Interior (Gleba):** White and firm when young, turning olive-brown and powdery at maturity.
* **Spore Release:** Occurs through a small pore at the top â€” releasing a visible brown puff when touched.

## Habitat

* **Substrate:** Prefers decaying wood, stumps, and mossy logs, though sometimes appears on bark of living trees where organic matter accumulates.
* **Environment:** Moist, shaded forests â€” often beneath oaks or maples.
* **Season:** Late summer through autumn, occasionally persisting into early winter.
