**Habitat:** Pine duff and grass near Lakeville, MN  
**Cap:** Smooth, clay-colored to tan  
**Gills:** Cream, close, exuding white latex that yellows on exposure  
**Stem:** Firm, hollowing with age  
**Spore print (expected):** Pale yellowish buff  

The clay-colored milkcap (*Lactarius argillaceifolius*) matched both size and color from the Audubon description. The cut stem revealed yellow flesh.

Unfortunately, the spore print (gray/black) did not match. This is actually a [Blackening Slimespike](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/blackening-slimespike/).
