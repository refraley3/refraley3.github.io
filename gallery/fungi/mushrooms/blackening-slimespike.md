# Blackening Slimespike (*Gomphidius* subroseus group)

![Blackening Slimespike spore print](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/assets/slimespike/spore-print.jpg)

**Habitat:** Under Douglas-fir (transplanted landscape grove, Lakeville, MN)  
**Cap:** Smooth and strongly **slimy** when fresh, clay-pink to tan, darkening with age  
**Gills:** Thick, waxy, slightly decurrent, eventually sooty  
**Stem:** Firm, glutinous, often darkening from the base upward  
**Spore print:** **Gray-black**, radiating clearly on paper  
**Flesh:** Whitish, staining darker over time  

> *Even the best field guess can change under the light of a spore print.*

## Field Story

At first glance, this mushroom seemed like a *Lactarius* — its smooth tan cap and forest-floor habit matched the *Argill Milkcap* descriptions in the Audubon guide.  
But once the **spore print appeared black-gray instead of yellowish**, the identification slipped away.

The cap’s slimy texture and the slow darkening of the stem hinted at a **Slimespike**, a member of *Gomphidius*, a genus that often hides under conifers.  
While *Blackening Slimespike* is most often recorded in the Pacific Northwest beneath Douglas-fir, the same host tree is sometimes **planted ornamentally or for reforestation** in Minnesota. This one was growing beneath a healthy stand of Douglas-fir — confirming that the partnership can extend well beyond its usual range.

## Observations

- **Spore Print:** Rich gray-black fan pattern — classic *Gomphidius*.  
- **Cap Surface:** Thick glutinous layer that can be peeled like a membrane.  
- **Gills:** Darkened within hours of collection.  
- **Reaction:** No milky latex observed — confirming it’s not *Lactarius*.

> *The forest is its own teacher: sometimes the answer only appears overnight on a sheet of paper.*
