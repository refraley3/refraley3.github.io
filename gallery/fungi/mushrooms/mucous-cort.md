**Mucous Cort beneath Red Pines**  
_Heavy slime glistens across the cap and stem, catching every bit of light in the pine duff._  
The Mucous Cort is a striking conifer associate—its entire surface cloaked in a glutinous layer that gives it an unmistakable sheen. Found beneath Red Pines, this species thrives in the acidic litter where few others fruit. • Size: 5309×3539  

Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM  
Settings: ISO 2000 • Aperture f/4.5 • Shutter 1/500 s

**Habitat:** Beneath Red Pines  
**Cap:** Slimy, glossy, amber to cinnamon-brown, darker toward the center  
**Gills:** Pale at first, becoming rusty-brown as spores mature  
**Stem:** Coated in transparent slime; pale beneath, narrowing toward the base  
**Spore print:** Rusty-brown  
**Flesh:** Pale yellowish, staining brownish when cut or bruised  

> *A mushroom that looks wet even when the forest floor is dry.*

### Field Story

When first found beneath the **Red Pines**, these mushrooms looked like **Slimespikes**—slender, brown-capped, and glistening in the dim light. But touching them revealed an even thicker slime coat than *Gomphidius*, a clue that shifted the ID toward *Cortinarius*.

The cap and stem remain coated with slime even in dry air. As the spores mature, the gills darken to rusty-brown and the flesh turns yellowish-brown when cut—a hallmark of *Cortinarius mucosus*. • Size: 5309×3539

- **Odor:** Earthy, faintly sweet or resinous  
- **Spore Print:** Rusty-brown  
- **Taste:** Mild to earthy (not tested further)  

### Spore Print

![Spore Print](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/assets/mucous-cort/E21A7054-1.jpg){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Spore Print"}  
**Spore Print**  
A soft, rusty spore print left by the Mucous Cort (*Cortinarius mucosus*). Its color—neither pale cream nor dark brown—marks it as a true *Cortinarius*. Under the Red Pines, it leaves a cinnamon shadow, quiet proof of the pine–fungus bond beneath the soil.  

> *Some identifications don’t come from color or cap, but from where your boots sink into the needles.*
