**Habitat:** Birch/conifer edge, grassy leaf litter  
**Cap:** Pale tan to off-white, dry and powdery (“floury”)  
**Gills:** White, free or nearly free from the stem  
**Stem:** Slender, pale; slight basal swelling possible  
**Notes:** Some *Amanita* species are dangerously toxic—photograph only.

> *A quiet, pale cap dusted as if with flour stood near the birches. The gills were immaculate white, the stem clean and simple—an understated *Amanita* and a fitting counterpoint to the louder forest colors.*
