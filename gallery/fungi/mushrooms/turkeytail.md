## Field Notes

These shelf-like fungi grew in layers along a fallen log near the pines, forming elegant fans of alternating color.  
The key identifying trait is the **pored underside**—not gills, not smooth—which confirms *Trametes versicolor*, the true Turkeytail.  

Several look-alikes exist (such as *Stereum* species), but they lack the pores and are smoother below.  
A small mirror might help photograph the underside without disturbance—but sometimes, lifting one gently for a look feels like part of the observation.

> *Each bracket a thin notebook, written in wood grain and spore dust.*

## Observations

- Found on a decaying hardwood log in partial shade.  
- Colors shifted subtly under changing humidity—deeper after rain, paler when dry.  
- The white pores formed a fine, even surface across each bracket’s underside.  
- The brackets’ edges curled slightly upward as they aged.

## Ecological Role

Turkeytails are **saprobic decomposers**, recycling the lignin and cellulose of dead wood.  
They’re widespread and often appear in the same spot year after year, slowly turning wood back into soil.
