## (*Mycena haematopus*) Infected by *Spinellus fusiger*

### Cold Forest

A quiet corner of the northern woods where the Bleeding Bonnet (*Mycena haematopus*) thrives.  
Even here, life gives way to life — a fungus consumed by another, framed in still air and soft light.

### Day 1 – Early Infection

**Bleeding Bonnet — Day 1, Early Infection**  
_Fine hyphae appear around the intact caps, marking the onset of mold colonization._  
The Bleeding Bonnet caps show early colonization. Fine hyphae are visible around the caps, but the structure of the mushrooms remains intact. • Size: 6720x4480  

Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM  
Settings: ISO 8000 • Aperture f/13.0 • Shutter 1/50 s

### Overview

These delicate **Bleeding Bonnet** mushrooms were photographed over three consecutive days, capturing the progression of an infection by the parasitic mold *Spinellus fusiger* — also known as the **pin mold fungus**. The series vividly illustrates how this fast-growing mold colonizes small mushrooms, forming a halo of fine white hyphae and spore-bearing sporangia that resemble tiny pins.

Bleeding Bonnet species are common wood decomposers, often found in damp forests on fallen logs or decaying bark. While beautiful on their own, the presence of *Spinellus fusiger* turns them into a striking natural study of fungal parasitism — a fungus growing on another fungus.

### The Infection Process

*Spinellus fusiger* begins as microscopic hyphae that invade the surface tissues of the mushroom’s cap. Within hours, the infection spreads, and the hyphae emerge as visible, hair-like filaments that radiate outward. By the second day, these filaments develop bulbous sporangia at their tips — structures that release thousands of spores to infect new hosts.

This process doesn’t immediately destroy the Bleeding Bonnet fruiting bodies but quickly halts their spore production, diverting the mushroom’s nutrients toward the invading mold.

### Day 2 – Expansion

**Bleeding Bonnet — Day 2, Extensive Mold Growth**  
_Long translucent hyphae radiate outward, giving the caps an ethereal halo._  
By the second day, the *Spinellus* mold has spread extensively. The translucent filaments catch the light, making this stage the most photogenic — a delicate balance of life and decay. • Size: 5015x3343  

Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM  
Settings: ISO 200 • Aperture f/22.0 • Shutter 4.0 s

### Day 3 – Collapse

**Bleeding Bonnet — Day 3, Collapse**  
_The hyphae thicken and the caps begin to shrink as nutrients are consumed._  
The mushrooms begin to collapse as nutrients are exhausted. The hyphae are dense, and the caps start to shrivel, marking the end of the visible infection cycle. • Size: 5015x3343  

Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM  
Settings: ISO 200 • Aperture f/18.0 • Shutter 15.0 s

![Bleeding Bonnet — Late Stage Infection](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/assets/bleeding-bonnet/E21A5430.jpg){: .cover role="img" aria-label="Bleeding Bonnet late-stage infection"}  
**Bleeding Bonnet — Hyphal Bridge**  
_Late stage fusion and spore-bearing filament growth._  
In advanced infection, the parasitic mold *Spinellus fusiger* sends out dense hyphae that weave between neighboring bonnets, creating the appearance of fused caps. Moisture clings to the softening tissue as the mold’s spore-bearing filaments spread across both mushrooms, anchored against a background of golden **Hypnum** moss. • Size: 1485x2227  

Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM  
Settings: ISO 100 • Aperture f/18.0 • Shutter 25.0 s

### Interesting Facts

- *Spinellus fusiger* is an **obligate parasite** of small mushrooms, especially *Bleeding Bonnet*, *Galerina*, and *Coprinellus* species.  
- The genus *Bleeding Bonnet* includes over 500 species, many bioluminescent — such as *Bleeding Bonnet chlorophos* and *Bleeding Bonnet haematopus*.  
- This relationship between two fungi is an example of **mycoparasitism**, a relatively rare but visually spectacular ecological interaction.
- The Spinellus fusiger fibers make these Mycena almost glow. Mycena chlorophos has a distingly tropical range. The Phillipines is one of the best places to see it glowing naturally.
