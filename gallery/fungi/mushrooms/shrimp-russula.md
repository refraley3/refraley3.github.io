### Field Story

When first found beneath the **Red Pines**, these mushrooms seemed to match the **Blackening Slimespike**—brown caps, thick gills, and the same pine-needle setting.  
Yet the **dry surface** and **brittle flesh** told another story. The cap edges cracked as they aged, and the gills broke cleanly under touch—a clue pointing toward the **Russulas**, not the slimy *Gomphidius*.

The Shrimp Russula, named for its faint **marine scent**, is part of a complex of species associated with conifers. It often shares the same habitat as Slimespikes and Milkcaps, each forming its own hidden relationship with the surrounding pines.

## Observations

- **Cap Color:** Rose to mahogany-brown, dull in dry weather, darker toward center.  
- **Flesh:** Brittle, snapping like chalk when broken.  
- **Odor:** Mild, sometimes sweet or reminiscent of shellfish.  
- **Spore Print:** White to cream, helping separate it from gray-spored *Gomphidius*.  
- **Taste:** Mild (tested cautiously), lacking the acrid burn of peppery Russulas.
