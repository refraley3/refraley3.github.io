# The Day of the Jumping Mushrooms

![Squirrel with mushroom](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/assets/misc/squirrel-jumping-mushroom.jpg)
*For a moment I thought a mushroom had learned to jump‚Äîuntil the tail gave it away.*

I watched a ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù leap from branch to branch and then to another pine tree‚Äîuntil it grew a tail.  
A red squirrel, commuting with breakfast.

Red squirrels sometimes harvest mushrooms and cache them to dry. My ‚Äújumper‚Äù was likely a **milkcap**, carried up from the forest floor.

## Turkey Tail ‚Äî the Grounded Recyclers

The layered brackets along a fallen log were classic **Turkey Tail**.  
The underside‚Äôs **fine white pores** clinched *Trametes versicolor*.

> I considered bringing a mirror to see the undersides without touching anything, but sometimes turning one cap over feels like part of the conversation‚Äîa way of meeting the forest halfway.

## The Likely Jumper ‚Äî Argill Milkcap (Revisited)

Under the pines, clay-colored caps with close gills matched **Argill Milkcap**  
(*Lactarius argillaceifolius*). The broken piece showed bright yellowing inside‚Äîconsistent with latex that turns yellow on exposure.

### üå≤ Update: The ‚ÄúJumping Mushroom‚Äù Identified

After collecting a spore print, the supposed *Argill Milkcap* revealed **gray-black spores** rather than yellowish.  
The cap‚Äôs **slimy texture** and **darkening stem** confirmed a different identity:  
**[Blackening Slimespike (*Gomphidius* subroseus group)](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/blackening-slimespike/)** ‚Äî a conifer associate most often found beneath **Douglas-fir**.  
Though native to the Pacific Northwest, this one appeared in Minnesota under a transplanted Douglas-fir grove.

> *Even the best field guess can change under the light of a spore print.*

### Habitat Note ‚Äî The ‚ÄúJumping‚Äù Tree

The host tree here appears to be a Douglas-fir, not native to Minnesota but thriving where it was likely planted.
In its natural range, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) grows west of the Continental Divide‚Äîfrom the Pacific Northwest down to the Monterey Bay region.
That divide forms a real geographic and ecological barrier, so its presence in Minnesota is almost certainly the result of human planting‚Äîfor windbreaks, Christmas tree farms, or forestry trials begun in the mid-20th century.
In this sense, the tree itself ‚Äújumped‚Äù the Divide, carried eastward by people rather than by chance.
And with it came the potential for its fungal partners, whether through soil, seedling roots, or spores traveling invisibly with us.
The red squirrel may move mushrooms across branches, but people move whole forests across continents.

> *Sometimes the biggest ‚Äújumping mushroom‚Äù is the one riding quietly in a nursery truck.*

## A Late Appearance ‚Äî Floury Amanita

Near the birches, pale mushrooms stood like small lanterns‚Äîdry, dusted as if with flour. I left them as I found them.

## Notes & Next Steps

- Spore print results now support the Slimespike identification.  
- Ongoing observations of Turkey Tail and Amanita growth continue into fall.  
- Photos taken near Lakeville, MN ‚Äî mild, damp mornings in conifer and edge habitat.
