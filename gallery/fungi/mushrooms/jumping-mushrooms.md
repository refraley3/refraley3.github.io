# The Day of the Jumping Mushrooms

*For a moment I thought a mushroom had learned to jump—until the tail gave it away.*

I watched a “mushroom” leap from branch to branch and then to another pine tree—until it grew a tail.  
A red squirrel, commuting with breakfast.

Red squirrels sometimes harvest mushrooms and cache them to dry. My “jumper” was likely a **milkcap**, carried up from the forest floor.

## Turkey Tail — the Grounded Recyclers

The layered brackets along a fallen log were classic **Turkey Tail**.  
The underside’s **fine white pores** clinched *Trametes versicolor*.

> I considered bringing a mirror to see the undersides without touching anything, but sometimes turning one cap over feels like part of the conversation—a way of meeting the forest halfway.

## The Likely Jumper — Argill Milkcap

Under the pines, clay-colored caps with close gills matched **Argill Milkcap**  
(*Lactarius argillaceifolius*). The broken piece showed bright yellowing inside—consistent with latex that turns yellow on exposure.

## A Late Appearance — Floury Amanita

Near the birches, pale mushrooms stood like small lanterns—dry, dusted as if with flour. I left them as I found them.

## Notes & Next Steps

- I’ll attempt a **spore print** for the milkcap (expected pale yellowish/buff).  
- Photos taken around Lakeville, MN; mild, damp mornings in conifer/edge habitat.
