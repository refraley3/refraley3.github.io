# The Day of the Jumping Mushrooms

![Squirrel with mushroom](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/assets/misc/squirrel-jumping-mushroom.jpg)
*For a moment I thought a mushroom had learned to jump—until the tail gave it away.*

I watched a “mushroom” leap from branch to branch and then to another pine tree—until it grew a tail.  
A red squirrel, commuting with breakfast.

Red squirrels sometimes harvest mushrooms and cache them to dry. My “jumper” was likely a **milkcap**, carried up from the forest floor.

## Turkey Tail — the Grounded Recyclers

The layered brackets along a fallen log were classic **Turkey Tail**.  
The underside’s **fine white pores** clinched *Trametes versicolor*.

> I considered bringing a mirror to see the undersides without touching anything, but sometimes turning one cap over feels like part of the conversation—a way of meeting the forest halfway.

## The Likely Jumper — Argill Milkcap (Revisited)

Under the pines, clay-colored caps with close gills matched **Argill Milkcap**  
(*Lactarius argillaceifolius*). The broken piece showed bright yellowing inside—consistent with latex that turns yellow on exposure.

### 🌲 Update: The “Jumping Mushroom” Identified

After collecting a spore print, the supposed *Argill Milkcap* revealed **gray-black spores** rather than yellowish.  
The cap’s **slimy texture** and **darkening stem** confirmed a different identity:  
**[Blackening Slimespike (*Gomphidius* subroseus group)](/gallery/fungi/mushrooms/blackening-slimespike/)** — a conifer associate most often found beneath **Douglas-fir**.  
Though native to the Pacific Northwest, this one appeared in Minnesota under a transplanted Douglas-fir grove.

> *Even the best field guess can change under the light of a spore print.*

## A Late Appearance — Floury Amanita

Near the birches, pale mushrooms stood like small lanterns—dry, dusted as if with flour. I left them as I found them.

## Notes & Next Steps

- Spore print results now support the Slimespike identification.  
- Ongoing observations of Turkey Tail and Amanita growth continue into fall.  
- Photos taken near Lakeville, MN — mild, damp mornings in conifer and edge habitat.
