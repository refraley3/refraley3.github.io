### (*Trichaptum biforme*)

A delicate bracket fungus that decorates dead hardwood with layered fans edged in violet. Its color fades with age, but when fresh, the purple margins make it one of the most recognizable wood decomposers in North American forests.

### Notes

This species is a common and harmless **saprobe**, meaning it feeds on decaying wood rather than living trees. The violet tones fade over time, leaving a silvery-gray pattern that can persist through winter. Its role in breaking down lignin and cellulose helps return nutrients to the soil, making it a quiet but essential part of forest ecology.
