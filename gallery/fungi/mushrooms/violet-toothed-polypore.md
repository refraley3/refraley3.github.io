### (*Trichaptum biforme*)

A delicate bracket fungus that decorates dead hardwood with layered fans edged in violet. Its color fades with age, but when fresh, the purple margins make it one of the most recognizable wood decomposers in North American forests.

### Identification

* **Genus:** *Trichaptum*
* **Common name:** Violet-toothed Polypore
* **Color:** Pale tan to gray with vivid violet edges (fresh); fades to brown with age
* **Underside:** Whitish to lavender with tiny irregular pores that resemble teeth
* **Texture:** Thin, papery, and slightly tough
* **Growth form:** Overlapping, semicircular brackets on dead hardwood
* **Spore print:** White

### Habitat

* **Substrate:** Dead hardwood logs and stumps, especially oak, maple, and birch
* **Environment:** Moist forest interiors and shaded woodlots
* **Season:** Year-round, most vibrant in spring and fall

### Notes

This species is a common and harmless **saprobe**, meaning it feeds on decaying wood rather than living trees. The violet tones fade over time, leaving a silvery-gray pattern that can persist through winter. Its role in breaking down lignin and cellulose helps return nutrients to the soil, making it a quiet but essential part of forest ecology.
