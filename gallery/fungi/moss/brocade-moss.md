## (*Hypnum imponens*)

A soft, feathery moss that forms lush mats across rotting logs and shaded forest floors.  
When illuminated, its overlapping branches create a rippling texture — the “brocade” that gives this species its common name.

- **Common name:** Brocade Moss  
- **Color:** Bright to yellow-green, often glossy when moist  
- **Growth form:** Feathery, interwoven mats with creeping stems

### Notes

*Hypnum imponens* is one of the most widespread mosses in North American forests.  
It can be distinguished from similar species by its glossy, feathery texture and softly curved leaves that lie closely pressed to the stem. The interwoven growth gives it a rich, fabric-like appearance — hence the name *Brocade Moss*.
