# Broom Moss (*Dicranum scoparium*)

A common and beautiful moss found in forest understories and on rotting logs.  
The tall reddish sporophyte stalks catch morning and evening light, making entire patches glow like miniature amber forests.

### Identification
- **Genus:** *Dicranum*  
- **Common name:** Broom Moss  
- **Color:** Bright green gametophytes with rust-brown sporophyte stalks  
- **Growth form:** Dense, upright tufts or mats, often forming soft cushions  
- **Habitat:** Moist woodlands, shaded rocks, and decaying wood

### Notes
*Dicranum scoparium* is one of the most common mosses in North America and can be identified by its sweeping, broom-like leaves that bend to one side. When wet, the leaves appear darker and more translucent.
