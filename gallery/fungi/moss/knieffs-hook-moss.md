## *Drepanocladus aduncus*

**Kneiff’s Hook-Moss (*Drepanocladus aduncus*)** is a distinctive pleurocarpous moss named for its **hooked, strongly curved leaves**—a feature that makes it one of the easiest wetland mosses to recognize. Its long, sweeping stems form loose, reclining mats in damp forest microhabitats, often mixing with lichens and other mosses along moist bark or decaying wood.

In Minnesota it is common in **seepage zones**, **stream margins**, **fen edges**, and shaded, moisture-holding bark—anywhere water persists long enough to support bryophyte growth.

## Photos

The colony in **Streambank Tangle** showcases the classic sweeping, secund leaves of **Knieff's Hook-moss**, mixed with [Mealy Shadow lichens](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/) in a cool, shaded microhabitat. Several sporophytes are visible in the upper right and lower left. The leaves curve **secund** (all to one side), giving each stem a gentle, flowing shape reminiscent of underwater vegetation.

**Barkside Cascade** presents a clear view of the moss’s drooping architecture, shaped by constant access to moisture from the nearby creek bed.  

The scene **Moss & Lichen Interlace** highlights a mixed epiphytic habitat enriched by constant moisture, allowing both moss and lichen species to flourish side by side.

## Identification

- **Growth form:** Pleurocarpous; long, reclining stems forming loose mats.  
- **Leaves:** Narrow, curved **secund** (hooked to one side), giving stems a flowing shape.  
- **Color:** Yellow-green to olive; often glossier in wet conditions.  
- **Texture:** Smooth, flexible, not tufted.  
- **Substrate:** Wet bark, decaying logs, peat, fen soils, marsh margins, seepage zones.  
- **Common associates:** *[Common Sunburst lichen](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/)*, *Physcia*, *Flavoparmelia*, and moisture-tolerant epiphytic mosses.

This species is frequently confused with *Scorpidium* or *Hypnum*, but the **strong leaf curvature** and **draping growth** help distinguish it.

---

## Habitat

*Drepanocladus aduncus* prefers environments where **water is present or persists**, including:

- Streambanks  
- Springs and seeps  
- Fens and calcareous wetlands  
- Damp forest bases  
- Moist, shaded bark on elm, ash, and maple  
- Decaying wood with long-lasting humidity  

These photos were taken near **flowing water**, a classic habitat where the moss’s long, flexible stems capture and hold moisture efficiently.
