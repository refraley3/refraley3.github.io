## Description

**Feather Moss** (*Hypnum curvifolium*) forms dense, low mats across logs, stumps, and shaded forest soil. Its shoots lie flattened against the substrate, with leaves that sweep distinctly to one side—a trait known as **secund curvature**, and a signature characteristic of this species.

Key identifying features include:

- **Fronds:** Fine, slender, and flattened, creating a soft, lace-like layer.  
- **Leaves:** Overlapping like shingles, narrow and curved in a single direction.  
- **Color:** Yellow-green to bright green when moist; slightly muted when dry.  
- **Growth habit:** Creeping and mat-forming, tightly adhering to wood or soil.

*H. curvifolium* is noticeably **finer and more compact** than the broader, taller fronds of *Hypnum imponens*.

_Short, slender sporophytes emerge sparsely from the fine mat of *H. curvifolium*, revealing the colony’s reproductive stage._  
The sporophytes are fewer and shorter than those of *H. imponens*, accentuating a key difference between the two species. • Size: 4480×6720

## Ecological Role

Feather Moss contributes significantly to forest-floor dynamics:

- Retains **moisture** in decaying wood and soil.  
- Provides **microhabitats** for small invertebrates and fungi.  
- Stabilizes **organic matter**, slowing erosion and aiding decomposition.  
- Supports **seedling establishment** by maintaining humidity around germinating plants.

Though delicate in appearance, its ecological importance is profound.
