In this composite, the dominant lime-green colony is *Hypnum imponens*, while a smaller patch of *Hypnum curvifolium* appears along the log in the upper left. The two species often grow together on decaying wood, their contrasting textures—broad fronds of *imponens* beside the finer, more compact *curvifolium*—highlighting the diversity within the genus. • Size: 6664×4444

## Description

**Feather Moss** (*Hypnum imponens*) is one of the most common and visually distinctive mosses in eastern and northern North America. Known for its **broad, featherlike fronds** and **abundant sporophytes**, it blankets logs, stumps, and shaded soil in lush, glossy mats.

Key identifying traits include:
- **Shoots:** Flattened, bright green to yellow-green, with leaves curved to one side (*secund*).
- **Leaves:** Broader and more robust than *H. curvifolium*, with a soft “shingled” texture.
- **Sporophytes:** Numerous, rising on thin reddish stalks with slender, cylindrical capsules.

In moist conditions, the plant glows with a vivid lime-green sheen—an effect captured clearly in the stacked image above.

*Hypnum imponens* favors cool, shaded forests where humidity remains high and decaying wood provides a stable substrate. • Size: 6664×4444

## Ecological Role

Feather Moss plays a vital part in the forest understory:

- **Moisture retention:** Acts as a sponge, stabilizing humidity and preventing soil erosion.  
- **Microhabitat creation:** Provides shelter for springtails, mites, and invertebrates.  
- **Nutrient cycling:** Slowly breaks down organic matter and aids fungal colonization.  
- **Forest regeneration:** Offers a moist substrate for seedling establishment.
