**Mealy Shadow** is a soft gray-green foliose lichen recognized by its **powdered lobes** and **shadowed apothecial discs**. Mealy Shadow is one of Minnesota’s most widespread bark lichens, often appearing as a quiet, neutral-toned companion beside brighter species such as *Candelaria concolor* and *Xanthoria parietina*.

For identification details and comparison with other similar species, see the [*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*](/field-notes/lichen/phaeophyscia-orbicularis/) in the **Field Notes** section.
