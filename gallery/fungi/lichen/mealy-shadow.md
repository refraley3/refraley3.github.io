## *Phaeophyscia orbicularis*

A soft gray-green foliose lichen recognized by its **powdered lobes** and **shadowed apothecial discs**. Mealy Shadow is one of Minnesota’s most widespread bark lichens, often appearing as a quiet, neutral-toned companion beside brighter species such as *Candelaria concolor* and *Xanthoria parietina*.

The colony forms dense, rounded patches of narrow lobes dusted with pale soredia. Dark-centered apothecia, when present, give the species its characteristic “shadowed” appearance.

## Description

**Mealy Shadow Lichen (*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*)** is a compact foliose species that adheres closely to bark, forming rounded mats of gray-green lobes. The lobes are **small (1–2 mm wide)**, slightly convex, and frequently dusted with **powdery soredia**, giving the upper surface a frosted or “mealy” texture.

The species is named for its distinctive **apothecia**: dark gray to nearly black discs surrounded by a paler rim. These shadowed centers are one of the most reliable field marks for the genus *Phaeophyscia*.

Mealy Shadow is abundant across the Midwest, thriving in **nutrient-enriched, moderately polluted, or urban environments** — conditions where more sensitive lichens may decline. Its combination of tolerance and rapid vegetative reproduction makes it a dominant foliose species in many mixed bark communities.

## Identification Notes

- **Thallus:** Gray-green, matte, tightly attached  
- **Lobes:** Very small (1–2 mm), rounded, sometimes overlapping in dense mats  
- **Soredia:** Abundant; concentrated along lobe margins and upper surfaces  
- **Apothecia:** Dark discs with pale, slightly raised rims  
- **Underside:** Pale to whitish, with sparse simple rhizines  
- **Habitat:** Hardwood bark, fence posts, urban and suburban trees, nitrogen-rich substrates  

**Common look-alikes**

- **Star Rosette (*Physcia stellaris*):** Whiter thallus, larger rosettes, apothecia with *white* or light rims  
- **Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*):** Larger lobes, bright green when moist, wrinkled surface  
- **Powdery Shield (*Physcia millegrana*):** Much smaller lobes (0.2–1.0 mm), finer powdering, paler gray tone

## Ecology

Mealy Shadow is one of Minnesota’s **most adaptable urban lichens**. It tolerates:

- moderate air pollution  
- nutrient-rich bark (especially nitrogen from bird perching sites)  
- prolonged dry periods  
- winter freeze-thaw cycles  

Its dense soredia enable rapid dispersal, allowing it to establish early on exposed bark. Where it grows alongside more sensitive foliose lichens — such as *Candelaria* or *Physcia aipolia* — it often helps indicate a **long-standing, stable microcommunity**.
