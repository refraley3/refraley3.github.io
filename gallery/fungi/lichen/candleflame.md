## *Candelaria concolor*

**Candleflame Lichen** is one of Minnesota’s most vivid yellow lichens—its powdery, lemon-yellow thallus standing out sharply against winter bark. Fine lobules and abundant soredia create a soft, glowing texture that catches light even in deep shade. Mature colonies may develop **tiny yellow apothecia**, but many consist entirely of granular, dust-like propagation structures.

## Description

*Candelaria concolor* is a **small foliose–squamulose lichen**, forming bright yellow, overlapping lobules only fractions of a millimeter wide. Its surface is dominated by **powdery soredia**, giving the thallus a matte, dusted texture. Colors range from **lemon-yellow to yellow-green**, often intensifying after rain or thaw.

Apothecia, when present, are **tiny flat yellow discs** with matching rims—less common than in rock-dwelling *Xanthoria* species.

Candleflame thrives on **deciduous bark**, old wooden rails, and nutrient-enriched substrates, and frequently appears near greenshield and other foliose lichens. It is especially successful on bark that receives intermittent light and airflow.

**Candleflame in the Company of a Shadow**, its warm yellow lobes erupt from a shadow of [Common Greenshield](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/). The *Candleflame* contrasting with the pale grays of [Powdery Shield](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/) and the muted green-gray tones of [Mealy Shadow](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/). Each species occupies a different microtexture of the elm bark: Candleflame filling cracks with its fine soredia, Powdery Shield forming crisp-edged tiny rosettes, and Mealy Shadow spreading more loosely across the surface. The three together reveal the complexity of lichen communities at sub-millimeter scales.

In **Star Rosette Among the Gold Dust**, the pale gray lobes of [**Star Rosette Lichen** (*Physcia stellaris*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/star-rosette/) form a cool counterpoint to scattered Candleflame soredia. The fine yellow dust settles into fissures around the rosettes, highlighting the contrasting propagation strategies between these species—*Candelaria* spreading by powdery granules, *Physcia* by tightly structured lobes and abundant apothecia.

## Identification

<div class="grid" role="list" style="justify-content: center; text-align: center;">

<div class="tile" style="margin: 15px; justify-content: left; text-align: left;">

- **Color:** Brilliant lemon-yellow to yellow-green; intensifies when wet  
- **Lobes:** Minute (0.2–1 mm), overlapping, often fringed  
- **Surface:** Heavily **sorediate**, giving a frosted or powdered look  
- **Apothecia:** Small (0.2–1.5 mm), yellow discs; variably present  
- **Underside:** Pale, lacking strong rhizines  
- **Growth form:** Squamulose–foliose cushions, irregularly expanding in patches

A compact cushion of **Candleflame Lichen (*Candelaria concolor*)** spreads across the gray bark, its vivid yellow lobules forming a shallow, budding colony only a few millimeters across. The scale beneath the patch highlights just how small these structures are—individual lobules measuring well under a millimeter, yet sharply defined against surrounding fragments of **Star Rosette** and other gray foliose species. This close measurement frame emphasizes the species’ minute growth form and the contrasting pigments that signal its presence even at tiny scales.

## Substrate & Habitat

- Found primarily on **deciduous bark** (elm, maple, ash, birch)  
- Also found on **twigs, wooden rails**, and nutrient-rich bark surfaces  
- Prefers **partial sun**, regular drying, and well-aerated bark  
- Often grows within multicolor lichen mosaics featuring greenshields, *Physcia*, and *Cladonia*

*Candelaria concolor* tolerates mild urban enrichment and can indicate **moderately clean to clean air**.
