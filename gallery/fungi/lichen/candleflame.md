Candleflame is a small but intensely colored yellow lichen that appears as soft, powdery patches on bark. Its fine lobules and abundant soredia give it a glowing, flame-like presence that stands out even at very small scales.

For identification details and comparison with similar species, see the **Field Notes** section, [*Candelaria concolor*](/field-notes/lichen/candelaria-concolor/).

## Visual Notes

This image shows a compact patch of Candleflame nestled among darker lichens and bark fissures. The **powdery soredia** collect along cracks and micro-ledges, creating a glowing contrast against the surrounding textures. Rather than forming a structured rosette, Candleflame spreads as fine granules and minute lobules, rewarding close inspection at macro scale.

## Context

Candleflame frequently grows alongside other small foliose lichens, where its intense yellow pigment and dusted surface distinguish it from larger sunbursts and greenshields. Its minute size and delicate structure make it easy to overlook, yet striking once noticed—especially during winter or damp conditions when color saturation increases.
