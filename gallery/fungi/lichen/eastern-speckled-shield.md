## [*Punctelia bolliana*](/field-notes/lichen/punctelia-bolliana/)
{: .taxonomy-last}

A tightly adnate colony of Eastern Speckled Shield spreads across bark, its pale green to olive thallus mottled with abundant white maculae. Numerous olive-toned apothecia dot the surface, each bordered by a persistent thalline margin. Moist winter conditions intensify the green coloration, revealing surface textures and reproductive structures that are often muted or obscured in drier seasons or dried reference material.

For detailed identification notes, comparison with similar species, and field observations, see the **Field Notes** page for [*Punctelia bolliana*](/field-notes/lichen/punctelia-bolliana/)

A close view of **Eastern Speckled Shield (*Punctelia bolliana*)** showing the pale gray foliose thallus with **dense black speckling** across the upper surface. The inclusion of a millimeter scale provides size context for the lobes and speckling, reinforcing overall growth habit and surface texture—useful field characters when separating *Punctelia* species from superficially similar foliose lichens.

### Eastern Speckled Shield — Lobe Detail

This detailed view highlights the **distinctive black speckling** on the upper surface of **Eastern Speckled Shield (*Punctelia bolliana*)**, a key feature separating it from Rough Speckled Shield. The broad, softly contoured lobes and evenly distributed speckles are especially clear under winter conditions, when moisture enhances contrast and surface definition.
