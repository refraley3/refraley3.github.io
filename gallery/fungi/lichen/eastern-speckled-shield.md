## *Punctelia bolliana*

**Punctelia bolliana** is a pale gray-green foliose lichen recognized by its **large, rounded lobes**, **distinct white pseudocyphellae**, and **dark brown to black underside** with simple rhizines. It is one of the most common *Punctelia* species on hardwood bark across the central and eastern United States and is frequently mistaken for *Flavoparmelia caperata* or *Physcia* species until the underside and pseudocyphellae are examined closely.

Broad, rounded lobes of **Eastern Speckled Shield (*Punctelia bolliana*)** form two clean rosettes at center, their pale surfaces marked with scattered white pseudocyphellae and faint speckling. To the lower left, a small colony of **[Powdery Shield (*Physcia millegrana*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/)** appears as fine, dusty gray lobes, highlighting how much smaller and more powder-dusted it is compared to *P. bolliana*. Surrounding the scene, **[Common Sunburst (*Xanthoria parietina*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/)** spreads in dense golden clusters, intensifying the cool tones and smooth foliose structure of Eastern Speckled Shield. The strong contrast between yellow crusts, dusty Physcia patches, and mint-gray rosettes makes the diagnostic traits of *P. bolliana* immediately visible at field scale.

This colony shows several diagnostic features of *P. bolliana*:  
- **white pseudocyphellae** scattered across the thallus surface  
- **large lobes** with smooth, rounded edges  
- **dark interior folds** at the lobe base (confirming a brown-to-black underside)  
- a subtly mottled gray-green pigmentation rather than the mint-green of *Flavoparmelia*.

The coloration of Punctelia bolliana shifts noticeably with moisture, a trait well illustrated in these observations. In dry conditions the thallus appears pale blue-gray, its cortex scattering light in a cool, silvery tone. When moisture is present—even a thin film from fog, dew, or snowfall—the lobes take on a paler green cast as the wet cortex becomes more translucent and the underlying algal layer shows through. The brighter green thallus seen in **Eastern Speckled Shield - Winter Rosette** was photographed during a light snow shower, when surface moisture momentarily enriched the color. This moisture-driven variation is typical of Eastern Speckled Shield and can change within minutes as conditions shift across the bark surface.

## Description

*Punctelia bolliana* forms **loosely attached foliose rosettes** ranging from a few centimeters to large, multi-rosette mats. The upper surface is smooth to slightly wrinkled, typically pale gray-green, and faintly mottled.  
Its most characteristic trait is the presence of **pseudocyphellae**—tiny white pores where the cortex is broken, dotting the thallus surface.

The lower surface is **dark brown to nearly black**, with **simple rhizines** concentrated toward the center and thinning at the margins.

This combination—gray thallus, white pseudocyphellae, black underside—is the core field diagnosis for the species.

### **Key features of *Punctelia bolliana***  
- **Thallus:** Pale gray-green; mottled, often pruinose  
- **Lobes:** Large (3–8 mm wide), rounded, overlapping  
- **Pseudocyphellae:** Small, white, abundant—*the most reliable field mark*  
- **Underside:** Dark brown to black with simple rhizines  
- **Apothecia:** Rare, brown with entire margins  
- **Chemistry:** Usually K+ yellow → red (in medulla), C–, P–  

### **Distinguishing from similar species**

- **vs. *Flavoparmelia caperata* (Common Greenshield)**  
  - *F. caperata* is yellow-green, never gray  
  - underside paler  
  - pseudocyphellae appear as pale cracks, not white dots  
  - lobes have a different wrinkled texture

- **vs. *Punctelia rudecta***  
  - *rudecta* has **larger, more ragged pseudocyphellae** and a rougher overall texture  
  - *bolliana* has clean, round, evenly scattered white pores

- **vs. *Physcia millegrana / stellaris***  
  - those species have tiny lobes (<1.5 mm), heavy soredia, and pale undersides  
  - *P. bolliana* has *much* larger lobes and a dark underside

This portrait highlights the subtle, diagnostic mix of traits: the pale gray-green color, the rounded lobes, and the numerous white pseudocyphellae that distinguish this species at a glance in macro view.

## Habitat

In Minnesota, *Punctelia bolliana* is commonly found on:

- **elm, oak, ash, and maple bark**  
- **open to lightly shaded exposures**  
- **mature bark surfaces** with stable moisture cycles  

It tolerates more urban and nitrogen-enriched environments compared to more sensitive foliose lichens like *Flavoparmelia*.
