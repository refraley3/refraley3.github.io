## Cladonia cristatella

**Brilliant red apothecia resembling tiny soldiers' caps.**  
This lichen’s bright scarlet fruiting bodies stand out against its pale green stalks, earning its iconic name “British Soldier.”

## Description
*Cladonia cristatella*, commonly known as the **British Soldier Lichen**, is a **fruticose lichen** with erect, stalk-like structures (podetia) that terminate in vivid red apothecia.  
The main thallus forms a **greenish-gray base layer**, from which the **upright podetia** rise 5–15 mm. These stalks are often branched, with granular or scaly surfaces. The red tips are spore-bearing structures.

This species prefers **well-lit, decaying wood, soil, or mossy substrates**, particularly in open forests, trailsides, and old stumps. It often coexists with *Candelaria*, *Flavoparmelia*, and other pioneer lichens.

The brilliant pigment derives from anthraquinones, which protect the lichen from UV radiation.

## Behavior
British Soldier lichens grow slowly, often taking years to reach noticeable size. They reproduce via **spores from the red apothecia** and through **fragmentation of the podetia**. Typically found in early-successional habitats where competition is minimal.

## Color
Podetia: **pale green to gray-green** from algae and fungal cortex.  
Apothecia: **intensely scarlet red**, forming the distinctive “caps.”

## Branching Podetia
Upright **branching podetia**, typically 5–15 mm tall, rough or granular in texture.

## Substrate
Base forms a **crustose or squamulose mat**, often interwoven with mosses or other lichens.

## Size
Entire lichen colony ranges from a few centimeters across; individual stalks **5–15 mm tall** and **0.5–1 mm thick**. Apothecia typically **0.5–1.5 mm** in diameter.
