{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**British Soldier Lichen** is instantly recognizable by its vivid **scarlet to crimson fruiting bodies**, which rise above a subdued green-gray basal thallus. The bright red apothecia resemble tiny caps or helmets, giving the species its evocative common name.

This lichen typically grows on **decaying wood, old stumps, and rotting logs**, often forming scattered colonies that punctuate mosses and other lichens with intense color.

For identification details and ecological notes, see the [British Soldier Lichen Field Notes](/field-notes/lichen/cladonia-cristatella/).
