## *Xanthoria parietina*

The vivid orange patches on tree bark belong to **Common Sunburst Lichen (*Xanthoria parietina*)**, one of the brightest and most recognizable lichens in Minnesota’s woodlands. Its intense yellow-orange pigmentation comes from **parietin**, a secondary metabolite that protects the lichen from intense sunlight and UV radiation, allowing it to thrive in exposed habitats where many foliose lichens cannot.

Although frequently encountered on bark, *X. parietina* also colonizes **rock**, **weathered wood**, and even **man-made substrates** such as old fence rails or shingles. On bark it often appears alongside species such as *Flavoparmelia caperata* (Common Greenshield), *Phaeophyscia orbicularis* (Mealy Shadow), and *Physcia aipolia* (Star Rosette), forming rich micro-communities across mature trunks.

## Description

The **Lichen Ember Cluster** image captures a compact, fractured expression of *X. parietina*, where its yellow-orange lobes erupt in scattered fragments across elm bark. Instead of forming a continuous patch, the colony breaks into glowing clusters, each surrounded by paler foliose neighbors such as **Mealy Shadow** and **Powdery Shield**. The result is a mosaic of warm pigments set against cooler grays.

The **Barkfire Spread** image reveals the full extension of a mature *X. parietina* colony across Northern Red Oak bark. Its lobes transition from **lemon-yellow** in the center to **deep orange** near the margins, where small granular soredia contribute to outward growth. Pale foliose lichens add contrast, and faint webbing suggests how many organisms occupy this same sheltered microhabitat.

**Golden Micro-Architecture** shifts the scale, emphasizing the sculptural quality of the curled, overlapping lobes. Tiny soredial granules highlight the uneven surfaces, while subtle moisture reflects along the ridges, turning the thallus into a miniature landscape.

## Identification

- **Color:** Bright lemon-yellow to deep orange; intensity increases with sun exposure  
- **Growth Form:** Crustose center with **foliose, lobed margins**  
- **Surface:** Smooth to granular; soralia common on edges and upper surface  
- **Apothecia:** Disc-like, orange to darker orange, often scattered irregularly  
- **Substrate:** Bark, rock, aged wood, and sun-exposed man-made surfaces  
- **Pigment:** Rich in **parietin**, providing UV protection and diagnostics

A diffuse patchwork of **Common Sunburst** spreads across elm bark, its yellow lobes forming a soft, scattered field rather than a single consolidated colony. Nearby **Mealy Shadow** lichens and patches of [Knieff's Hook-Moss](/gallery/fungi/moss/knieffs-hook-moss/) interlace with the texture of the bark, creating a subdued composition compared to the more intense colonies shown above.

Sunburst favors **sunny, dry conditions**, thriving on rough bark that warms quickly and sheds moisture rapidly. Its parietin-rich pigmentation allows the species to colonize surfaces with high UV exposure, including **open-grown trees**, **trail edges**, and even **coastal or alpine rock** in other regions.
