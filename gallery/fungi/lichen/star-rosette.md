## *Physcia stellaris*

**Star Rosette Lichen** forms tidy gray foliose rosettes marked by distinctive **white-rimmed apothecia**, giving the thallus a subtle starburst pattern. These pale, elevated rims sharply contrast with the darker disc at the center, making *P. stellaris* one of the most easily recognized bark-dwelling *Physcia* species.

## Description

**Star Rosette Lichen (*Physcia stellaris*)** is a compact, evenly rounded foliose lichen commonly forming rosettes several centimeters across. Its lobes are **small, rounded, and slightly pruinose**, giving the thallus a soft, frosted appearance.

The species’ most diagnostic feature is its **lecanorine apothecia** — dark discs encircled by **pale or white rims** that stand out clearly even on weathered bark. These bright margins are often visible before the rosettes themselves are noticed.

The surface texture is matte to lightly dusted, contrasting with sharper or more wrinkled neighbors.

## Identification

### **Key features of *Physcia stellaris***

- **Thallus:** Pale gray to blue-gray; sometimes with a faint frost-like bloom  
- **Lobes:** Small (0.5–1.5 mm), rounded, overlapping; edges smooth or gently upturned  
- **Apothecia:** Abundant; **white-margined**; centers gray to dark brown  
- **Underside:** Pale to light brown; short, simple rhizines  
- **Chemistry:** Typically **K–**, **C–**, **KC–**, **P–**  

### **Easily confused with, but distinguishable from:**

<div class="grid" role="list" style="justify-content: center; text-align: center;">

<div class="tile" style="margin: 15px; justify-content: left; text-align: left;">

- **Physcia aipolia (White-spotted Physcia, not shown):**  
  More contrasting maculae and *dark*-rimmed apothecia; *stellaris* has pale rims.

- **Phaeophyscia orbicularis (Mealy Shadow):**  
  Lacks white apothecial rims; darker thallus with more granular margins.

- **Physcia millegrana (Powdery Shield):**  
  Much smaller lobes (0.2–1.0 mm), more uniformly powder-dusted; lacks the crisp apothecial architecture of *stellaris*.

The pale lichens surrounding the Candleflame cluster illustrate two species often mistaken for Star Rosette (Physcia stellaris)—yet their differences become clear at close range. [Powdery Shield (Physcia millegrana)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/), appearing here as extremely small, fine-lobed rosettes dusted with soredia, lacks the crisp white-rimmed apothecia that define Star Rosette. Beside it, [Mealy Shadow (Phaeophyscia orbicularis)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/) showing darker, soot-toned centers and matte gray lobes with noticeably broader lobe widths than P. stellaris. This single frame captures the diagnostic trio: [Candleflame’s](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/) yellow flare below, and above it the powdery, shadowed tones that distinguish two common Physciaceae from their more sharply patterned relative.

## Habitat

Star Rosette is common on:

- **elm, maple, oak, ash**, and various hardwoods  
- **lightly shaded to open** bark exposures  
- **mature, mid-textured bark** with stable moisture cycles  

It tolerates moderate dryness but grows best where surfaces dry quickly after precipitation. Winter sun and frost often enhance the visibility of its pale tones, making rosettes easier to spot.

A close look reveals the delicate architecture of coexisting lichens. Each thrives where light, moisture, and bark chemistry allow, creating a natural mosaic that shifts with season and exposure. Together, they form a study in quiet persistence and shared resilience.

Star Rosette favors **clean to moderately clean air** and often co-occurs with foliose *Physcia*, *Flavoparmelia*, and the brightly colored *Candelaria* and *Xanthoria* species.
