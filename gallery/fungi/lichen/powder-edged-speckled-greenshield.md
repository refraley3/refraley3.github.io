{: .taxonomy-last}

**Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield (*Flavopunctelia soredica*)** is a common foliose bark lichen with a pale yellow-green thallus, conspicuous white pseudocyphellae, and powdery soralia concentrated along lobe margins. It commonly forms loose rosettes or irregular patches on hardwoods and contributes to mixed-species bark mosaics.

For identification details and comparison with similar species, see the [*Flavopunctelia soredica*](/field-notes/lichen/flavopunctelia-soredica/) Field Notes page.

## Description

**Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield (*Flavopunctelia soredica*)** is a foliose lichen with a pale yellow-green to gray-green thallus, abundant white pseudocyphellae, and powdery soralia typically concentrated along lobe margins. Lobes are broad and rounded, often forming loose rosettes or irregular patches on bark.

---

## Identification

### Key Features

- **Growth form:** Foliose, loosely attached, irregular rosettes or patches  
- **Color:** Pale yellow-green to gray-green  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, slightly overlapping  
- **Pseudocyphellae:** Abundant white speckling on the upper surface  
- **Soralia:** Powdery, white, typically margin-focused  
- **Lower surface:** Dark brown to black with simple rhizines

### Distinguishing Notes

- **vs. Flavopunctelia flaventior:** (notes as applicable)  
- **vs. Powdery Shield:** Powder-edged species shows strongly marginal soralia; Powdery Shield is more uniformly dusted.  
- **vs. Common Greenshield (Flavoparmelia caperata):** Common Greenshield is smoother and inflated, without white speckling.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

Found primarily on hardwood bark (elm, maple, ash, oak) in well-lit trunks and branches across forests, parks, and urban areas. Tolerant of moderate air pollution and commonly part of mixed-species bark communities.

---

## Photo Notes

Images show marginal soralia and distinctive pseudocyphellae that help separate *Flavopunctelia soredica* from superficially similar green foliose lichens.

## *Flavopunctelia soredica*

**Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield (*Flavopunctelia soredica*)** is a common foliose lichen of hardwood bark, recognized by its **pale yellow-green thallus**, **distinct white speckling (pseudocyphellae)**, and **powdery soralia concentrated along lobe margins**. It often forms loose rosettes or irregular patches and is especially noticeable where the lobe edges appear dusted or frosted.

## Key Identification Features

- **Growth form:** Foliose, loosely attached, forming irregular rosettes or patches  
- **Color:** Pale yellow-green to gray-green  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, often slightly overlapping  
- **Pseudocyphellae:** Abundant, white, irregularly scattered across the upper surface  
- **Soralia:** Powdery, white to pale, typically **edge-focused** and sometimes extending inward  
- **Lower surface:** Dark brown to black with simple rhizines  

---

## Habitat & Ecology

Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield is most often found on **hardwood bark**, including elm, maple, ash, and oak. It favors well-lit trunks and branches in forests, parks, and urban environments. Its tolerance of moderate air pollution allows it to persist in a wide range of settings.
