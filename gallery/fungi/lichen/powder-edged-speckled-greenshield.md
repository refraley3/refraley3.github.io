## *Flavopunctelia soredica*

**Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield (*Flavopunctelia soredica*)** is a common foliose lichen of hardwood bark, recognized by its **pale yellow-green thallus**, **distinct white speckling (pseudocyphellae)**, and **powdery soralia concentrated along lobe margins**. It often forms loose rosettes or irregular patches and is especially noticeable where the lobe edges appear dusted or frosted.

## Key Identification Features

- **Growth form:** Foliose, loosely attached, forming irregular rosettes or patches  
- **Color:** Pale yellow-green to gray-green  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, often slightly overlapping  
- **Pseudocyphellae:** Abundant, white, irregularly scattered across the upper surface  
- **Soralia:** Powdery, white to pale, typically **edge-focused** and sometimes extending inward  
- **Lower surface:** Dark brown to black with simple rhizines

## Habitat & Ecology

Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield is most often found on **hardwood bark**, including elm, maple, ash, and oak. It favors well-lit trunks and branches in forests, parks, and urban environments. Its tolerance of moderate air pollution allows it to persist in a wide range of settings.

## Distinguishing Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield from Similar Species

- **vs. (*Flavopunctelia flaventior)**  

- **vs. Powdery Shield (*Punctelia bolliana*)**  
  - *F. sorediata* has **strongly marginal, powdery soralia**.  
  - Powdery Shield tends to appear more uniformly dusty across the surface.  

- **vs. American Starburst (*Imshaugia placorodia*)**  
  - Starburst has **larger, more angular lobes** and lacks prominent marginal soralia.  
  - *F. sorediata* shows clearer speckling and edge powdering.

- **vs. Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)**  
  - Common Greenshield is **smoother and more inflated**, without white speckling.  
  - *F. sorediata* is flatter and visibly speckled.

## Field Notes

Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield is often misidentified as other green foliose lichens at a glance. Careful attention to **white speckling** and **edge-focused powdery soralia** provides a reliable identification without chemical tests.
