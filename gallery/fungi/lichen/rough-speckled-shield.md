This gallery documents **Rough Speckled Shield** growing on mature bark, showing the species’ broad, rounded lobes and lightly textured surface. Smaller gray foliose lichens and scattered yellow sunburst species are present in the surrounding bark community.

For identification notes and comparison with similar shield lichens, see the **Field Notes** page: [*Punctelia rudecta*](/field-notes/lichen/punctelia-rudecta/).

Broad, overlapping lobes form a loose rosette against deeply furrowed bark. Subtle shifts from cool gray to pale blue emerge across the matte surface, with softened edges and gentle shadows giving the thallus a sculpted, layered appearance. Smaller gray lichens and flecks of yellow occupy the surrounding bark, adding contrast without competing for attention.

A broad rosette, roughly three centimeters across, spreads over the bark of an oak tree. Pale gray lobes form a loose, bushy pattern. Nearby, smaller lichens cluster in bark crevices—some so compact that their entire thallus is comparable in size to a single lobe of the larger rosette—highlighting the contrast in scale within this bark-lichen community.

**Context on Oak Trunk**  
_The lichen in situ on a mature tree trunk, surrounded by a diverse bark-lichen community._

A section of mature oak bark supports a dense assemblage of foliose and sunburst lichens. Broad gray rosettes dominate the surface, while smaller gray and yellow colonies occupy fissures and edges of peeling bark. The composition emphasizes how larger shield lichens anchor the community, with finer forms filling the surrounding texture of the trunk.
