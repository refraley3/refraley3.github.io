## *Punctelia rudecta*

**Rough Speckled Shield Lichen** is a pale gray to gray-green foliose lichen recognized by its **distinct white punctate pseudocyphellae**, **broad, overlapping lobes**, and a **roughened, uneven upper surface**. It grows on hardwood bark and is among the most conspicuous *Punctelia* species in the Upper Midwest.

This image shows a **well-developed thallus** with **broad, loosely adnate lobes** and a pale gray surface dotted with numerous **white pseudocyphellae**. The scale provides context for lobe width and overall thallus size, both useful for separating *Punctelia* from smaller *Physcia* species.

The **subirregular, overlapping lobes** and **matte, lightly wrinkled cortex** are characteristic of *Punctelia rudecta*. The pale gray coloration contrasts with darker bark and nearby crustose lichens, making the species easy to recognize at mid-range distances.

This wider view places Rough Speckled Shield within a **diverse bark community**, illustrating its tendency to form **distinct foliose patches** among crustose yellows and smaller gray lichens. Such images help distinguish *Punctelia* species by overall growth habit rather than fine detail alone.

## Description

*Punctelia rudecta* is recognized by:

- **Thallus:** pale gray to gray-green  
- **Growth form:** foliose, loosely adnate  
- **Lobes:** broad, rounded to irregular, typically 4–10 mm wide  
- **Surface:** roughened to uneven, densely marked with **white punctate pseudocyphellae**  
- **Soredia:** absent  
- **Isidia:** absent  
- **Underside:** black centrally, brown toward the margins  
- **Rhizines:** black, simple, moderately dense  

Thalli form **rounded rosettes or irregular patches** on hardwood bark, often becoming quite large with age.

---

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** pale gray to gray-green  
- **Lobes:** broad and overlapping  
- **Surface:** visibly speckled with white pseudocyphellae  
- **Reproductive structures:** typically lacking soredia and isidia  
- **Underside:** black with simple rhizines  

- **Chemistry:** medulla **K+ yellow** (atranorin derivatives)

#### [Rough Speckled Shield (*Punctelia rudecta*) — Consortium of Lichen Herbaria](https://lichenportal.org/portal/taxa/index.php?taxon=54657)
- **Thallus:** foliose, medium sized, to 8 cm; lobate 
- **lobes:** plane, linear to subirregular, spreading, 4-7 mm 
- **Upper surface:** bluish gray to light mineral gray, shiny, sometimes cracked; 
- **Margin:** tinged with brown, rarely pruinose 
- **Pseudocyphellae:** white, common, irregular in shape, 
- **isidia:** sometimes coalescing  occasional to frequent, short, smooth and corticate, simple to forked or coralloid, brown-tipped, often arising from pseudocyphellae and cortical cracks, not breaking up into soredia-like masses, occasionally becoming extremely dense and "mounded" obscuring the thallus lobes 
- **lower surface:** pale, white to flesh-colored or more brown; 
- **rhizines:** simple to forked, concolorous with the lower surface or white 
- **Apothecia:** very rare and immature in Sonoran material 
- **Pycnidia:** not seen in Sonoran specimens

**Pseudocyphellae Detail**

{: .caption}

This close view highlights the **diagnostic white pseudocyphellae**, appearing as small, sharply defined dots across the cortex. These pores are a defining feature of *Punctelia* and immediately separate Rough Speckled Shield from similar gray foliose lichens lacking true pseudocyphellae.

**Surface Texture Detail**  
_Roughened cortex with dense pseudocyphellae._  
Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV

{: .caption}

The **uneven, slightly pitted surface texture**, combined with dense pseudocyphellae, gives Rough Speckled Shield its characteristic “rough” appearance at close range.

---

These traits distinguish *Punctelia rudecta* from:

- **Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)** — lacks pseudocyphellae and is typically sorediate  
- **Eastern Speckled Shield (*Flavopunctelia* spp.)** — similar speckling but differs in chemistry and surface texture  
- **Physcia species** — smaller lobes and different reproductive structures  

---

## Habitat

Rough Speckled Shield favors:

- **Hardwood trunks**, especially oak, maple, and elm  
- **Moderate shade** with good air circulation  
- **Stable, long-established bark surfaces**

Colonies may persist for many years, gradually expanding and coalescing with neighboring thalli.

---

## Fun Fact

The white speckles on Rough Speckled Shield are **pseudocyphellae**, tiny pores that facilitate gas exchange—an adaptation that also makes the genus *Punctelia* immediately recognizable in the field.
