### *Xanthomendoza ulophyllodes*
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

Powdery Sunburst is a vivid yellow to orange foliose lichen that stands apart from other Minnesota sunbursts by its **thicker thallus and firm attachment to bark via true rhizines**. Colonies often appear more three-dimensional and cohesive, forming bold patches that can dominate sections of a tree trunk.

For identification details and comparison with other sunburst lichens, see the **Field Notes** section [Xanthomedoza ulophyllodes](/field-notes/lichen/xanthomendoza-ulophyllodes/).
