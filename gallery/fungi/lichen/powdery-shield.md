## Description

The *Powdery Shield* forms tiny overlapping lobes, giving a frosted or dusty appearance.  
The upper surface is gray-green and often dotted with fine white soredia — powder-like granules used for reproduction.  
This species prefers nutrient-balanced, clean air and often appears alongside *Candelaria concolor* or *Physcia aipolia* on bark and branches.  

**Thallus type:** Foliose (leaf-like, loosely attached)  
**Color:** Gray-green to pale olive  
**Surface:** Dusted with soredia; lacks fruiting discs  
**Habitat:** Bark of hardwoods, fence posts, and occasionally rock  
**Indicator value:** Sensitive to air pollution; presence indicates good air quality

## Photographer’s Perspective

The pairing of *Candelaria concolor* and *Physcia millegrana* captures a subtle narrative —  
two lichens sharing light and surface, each revealing a different tone of resilience.  
The composition balances color and texture: Candleflame’s warmth and Powdery Shield’s calm neutrality.
