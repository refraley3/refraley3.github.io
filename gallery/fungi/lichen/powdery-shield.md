## [*Physcia millegrana*](/field-notes/lichen/physcia-millegrana/)  
{: .taxonomy-last}

A compact cluster of **Powdery Shield (*Physcia millegrana*)** occupies the center of the bark ridge, its tiny lobes coated in fine soredia. The surrounding species sharpen its identification: bright **Common Sunburst** to the left provides vivid contrast, while the broad, pale-green lobes of **Eastern Speckled Shield** at right emphasize the minute scale and powdery texture that distinguish *P. millegrana* in mixed lichen communities. Powdery Shield Lichen is one of Minnesota's most common small foliose lichens, recognized by its soft, powder-dusted surface and compact growth form. Its fine **soredia** give the thallus a matte, frosted look that distinguishes it from darker, more textured Physcia relatives.

For identification details and comparison with other similar species, see the [*Physcia millegrana*](/field-notes/lichen/physcia-millegrana/) in the **Field Notes** section.
