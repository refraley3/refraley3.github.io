{: .taxonomy-last}

A compact cluster of **Powdery Shield (*Physcia millegrana*)** occupies the center of the bark ridge, its tiny lobes coated in fine soredia. The surrounding species sharpen its identification: bright **Common Sunburst** to the left provides vivid contrast, while the broad, pale-green lobes of **Eastern Speckled Shield** at right emphasize the minute scale and powdery texture that distinguish *P. millegrana* in mixed lichen communities. Powdery Shield Lichen is one of Minnesota's most common small foliose lichens, recognized by its soft, powder-dusted surface and compact growth form. Its fine **soredia** give the thallus a matte, frosted look that distinguishes it from darker, more textured Physcia relatives.

For identification details and comparison with other similar species, see the [*Physcia millegrana*](/field-notes/lichen/physcia-millegrana/) in the **Field Notes** section.

## Description

**Powdery Shield Lichen** is a small, pale gray foliose species with a characteristic **matte, dusted surface**. This look comes from abundant **soredia**, tiny powder-like reproductive granules that spread easily across bark. It forms small, loosely organized rosettes or diffuse patches, often blending into the bark more subtly than brighter species like [Candleflame](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/) or [Common Sunburst](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/).

Typical companions on Minnesota hardwoods include:

- [Candleflame (*Candelaria concolor*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/)  
- [Mealy Shadow (*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/)  
- [Star Rosette (*Physcia stellaris*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/star-rosette/)  
- [Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/)

Powdery Shield is an **air-quality indicator**, thriving in areas with clean, well-circulated air.

## Identification

### Key Features

- **Color:** Pale gray, blue-gray, or slightly olive  
- **Surface:** Frosted or powder-dusted appearance from abundant soredia  
- **Lobes:** Extremely small (0.2–1.0 mm), rounded, tightly overlapping  
- **Reproduction:** Apothecia rare or absent — dispersal is primarily by soredia  
- **Underside:** Pale, with short, simple rhizines; edges often slightly uplifted  
- **Growth Form:** Small foliose rosettes or irregular patches, often intermixing with other bark lichens  

### Distinguishing from Similar Species

- **vs. *Physcia dubia*:** Less uniformly dusted, forms tighter rosettes with slightly shinier surface.  
- **vs. *Physcia tenella*:** Lobes longer, soredia at tips; may develop apothecia. Powdery Shield lacks apothecia and appears uniformly dusty.  
- **vs. *Physcia adscendens*:** Never forms hooded lobe tips; consistently powder-dusted surface.  
- **vs. *Physcia caesia*:** More blue-gray overall; Powdery Shield is paler with softer, more granular surface.  
- **vs. *Phaeophyscia* species:** Noticeably lighter, finer, and more powder-coated than darker Phaeophyscia.

## Habitat and Ecology

Powdery Shield grows on:

- **hardwood bark** (maple, elm, ash, oak)  
- **twigs and young branches**  
- **old fence rails and posts**  
- occasionally on weathered outdoor wood  

It prefers **open or lightly shaded habitats** where bark dries intermittently and receives scattered sunlight. Its sensitivity to sulfur and nitrogen pollution makes it a valuable **indicator of clean air**.
