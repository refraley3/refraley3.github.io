## *Physcia millegrana*

### Dusted in Light and Air

Tiny gray foliose rosettes that seem to bloom like frost across twigs and bark.  

**Powdery Shield Lichen** is one of Minnesota’s most common small foliose lichens, recognized by its soft, powder-dusted surface and compact growth form. Its fine **soredia** give the thallus a matte, frosted look that distinguishes it from darker, more textured Physcia relatives.

## Description

**Powdery Shield Lichen** is a small, pale gray foliose species with a characteristic **matte, dusted surface**.  
This look comes from abundant **soredia**, tiny powder-like reproductive granules that spread easily across bark.

It forms small, loosely organized rosettes or diffuse patches, often blending into the bark more subtly than brighter species like Candleflame or Sunburst.

Typical companions on Minnesota hardwoods include:

- [**Candleflame (*Candelaria concolor*)**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/)  
- [**Mealy Shadow (*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*)**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/)  
- [**Star Rosette (*Physcia stellaris*)**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/star-rosette/)  
- [**Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/)

Powdery Shield is an **air-quality indicator**, thriving in areas with clean, well-circulated air.

## Identification

### Key Features

- **Color:** Pale gray, blue-gray, or slightly olive  
- **Surface:** Frosted or powder-dusted appearance from abundant soredia  
- **Lobes:** Extremely small (0.2–1.0 mm), rounded, tightly overlapping  
- **Reproduction:** Apothecia rare or absent — dispersal is primarily by soredia  
- **Underside:** Pale, with short, simple rhizines; edges often slightly uplifted  
- **Growth Form:** Small foliose rosettes or irregular patches, often intermixing with other bark lichens  

**Powdery Shield Lichen (*Physcia millegrana*)** forms dense, pale gray foliose patches composed of very small, irregularly branched lobes. Its defining characteristic is the presence of **abundant powdery soredia** across the upper surface and margins, creating a frosted or dusted appearance that is visible even at a modest viewing distance.  

Two close-scale images illustrate these diagnostic traits:

_Fine, powdery soredia coat the upper surface of *Physcia millegrana*, giving the thallus its frosted texture. A single upturned lobe reveals a pale underside—lighter than the neighboring Mealy Shadow—confirming foliose attachment and the species’ tightly clustered growth form._

_Tightly packed, minute lobes form a compact foliose mat, their pale gray surfaces contrasting with the darker bark beneath. Slight uplift along the lobe margins hints at the pale underside typical of *P. millegrana*, while the dense, irregular branching differentiates it from larger foliose Physcia species or nearby Mealy Shadow patches._

Together, these views show the two most important diagnostic features:  
**(1) abundant soredia frosting the thallus**, and  
**(2) tiny, densely overlapping lobes with a pale underside**, distinguishing *P. millegrana* from species such as Hammered Shield (*Punctelia rudecta*) or Mealy Shadow (*Physcia aipolia*).

### Distinguishing Powdery Shield from Similar Species

- **vs. Mealy Shadow (*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*)**  
  - Mealy Shadow is *darker*, more *granular*, with more defined rosettes.  
  - Powdery Shield is *lighter* and more *uniformly dusty* in appearance.

- **vs. Star Rosette (*Physcia stellaris*)**  
  - Star Rosette has **white-rimmed apothecia**.  
  - Powdery Shield generally **lacks apothecia** and appears softer.

- **vs. Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)**  
  - Greenshield is large and leafy with wide lobes.  
  - Powdery Shield is tiny, delicate, and fine-textured.

- **vs. Hammered Shield (*Parmeliopsis ambigua*)**  
  - Hammered Shield has a “hammered metal” surface with stippling.  
  - Powdery Shield has a smoother, more powdery texture.

## Habitat

Powdery Shield grows on:

- **hardwood bark** (maple, elm, ash, oak)  
- **twigs and young branches**  
- **old fence rails and posts**  
- occasionally on weathered outdoor wood  

It prefers **open or lightly shaded habitats** where bark dries intermittently and receives scattered sunlight.  
Its sensitivity to sulfur and nitrogen pollution makes it a valuable **indicator of clean air**.

## Photographer’s Perspective

Powdery Shield’s subtlety is its beauty —  
a lichen that rarely demands attention yet rewards close examination.  
Its matte surface plays softly with winter light, especially when paired with brighter species like Candleflame.  
In mixed communities, its dusty rosettes often provide the cool counterbalance to warmer, more vibrant neighbors.
