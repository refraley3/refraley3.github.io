# Common Greenshield Lichen on Elm

## üåø Observation
While walking through a mixed woodland this morning, I noticed several round, greenish patches on the trunk of an elm tree. The pale, leafy lobes and black-veined underside identify them as **Common Greenshield Lichen (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)** ‚Äî one of Minnesota‚Äôs most widespread bark lichens.

Lichens do not have roots; nutrients are extracted from the air, making them sensitive to air quality. There presence indicates **clean air** and health forest conditions, thriving especially in shaded or semi-open habitats.

## üîç Identification Notes
- **Color:** Pale green to yellowish-green, turns brighter when wet.  
- **Form:** Foliose (leaf-like) with broad lobes, slightly wrinkled surface.  
- **Underside:** Black with pale veins and short rhizines.  
- **Substrate:** Elm bark ‚Äî medium texture and neutral pH support good lichen growth.  
- **Air Quality Indicator:** Abundant presence suggests healthy, low-pollution air.

## üß≠ Habitat
Found in a quiet stand of mixed hardwoods with scattered elm, oak, and maple.  
Moist fall weather and shaded conditions likely helped preserve vivid color and texture.

### üí° Fun Fact
*Flavoparmelia caperata* produces **caperatic acid**, which helps protect it from microbial damage and UV exposure ‚Äî one reason it can live for decades on the same trunk.
