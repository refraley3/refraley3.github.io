## *Flavoparmelia caperata*

**Common Greenshield Lichen** is a pale yellow-green foliose species with **broad, smooth, loosely attached lobes** forming rounded mats on hardwood bark. The upper surface is often gently wrinkled and **laminally sorediate**, while margins lift slightly to reveal a **dark lower surface that grades from black centrally to brown toward the edges**, bearing **simple black rhizines**.

The **Greenshield Circle** image shows a near-perfect foliose rosette centered on deeply fissured elm bark, surrounded by bright crustose yellows and scattered gray foliose neighbors. The matte surface and pale green hue create a calm focal point against the rough, dark background.

This wider field view shows **Common Greenshield** growing as **discrete foliose patches** on a mature hardwood trunk. The **pale yellow-green thalli**, loosely adnate with rounded lobes, contrast against dark, fissured bark and neighboring crustose lichens. Images like this provide important **ecological context**, illustrating how *Flavoparmelia caperata* often appears as scattered rosettes rather than a single continuous thallus.

This specimen shows the characteristic **loosely adnate foliose thallus** of Common Greenshield, with **subirregular, overlapping lobes** and a **powdery to granular sorediate surface**. The **yellow-green coloration**, absence of cilia or isidia, and laminal soredia spreading across the upper surface are consistent with *Flavoparmelia caperata*.

This **lobe detail study** highlights the overlapping, gently wrinkled lobes of Greenshield, each with soft translucence toward the edges. Fine granular soredia and a subtle sheen become visible at macro scale, along with darkening toward the lobe bases where rhizines anchor the thallus to bark.

This species is a reliable **air-quality indicator**, tending to be more frequent and better developed where long-term atmospheric conditions are clean and stable.

## Description

*Flavoparmelia caperata* is recognized by:

- **Pale yellow-green thallus**, appearing green-gray in shade  
- **Wide lobes**, typically **5–13 mm** across, smooth to gently wrinkled  
- **Soredia:** laminal, granular to wart-like, often becoming diffuse and confluent  
- **Isidia:** absent  
- **Underside:** black centrally, grading to brown and naked toward the margins  
- **Rhizines:** simple, black, denser toward the center  
- **Foliose growth**, loosely attached except at central points  

Greenshield forms **discrete foliose rosettes** or broader, merging patches on tree trunks, especially on **oak, maple, elm**, and other moderately textured bark.

---

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** Pale yellow-green; never blue-gray  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, 5–13 mm wide  
- **Surface:** Smooth to gently rugose, laminally sorediate  
- **Underside:** Black centrally, brown toward margins  
- **Sorediation:** Present and laminal—distinguishes it from *Physcia* and *Phaeophyscia*  
- **Attachment:** Loosely foliose, margins lifting easily  

- **Chemistry:** Medulla **K+ bright yellow** (caperatic acid)

This focus-stacked composite emphasizes the **laminal distribution of granular to wart-like soredia** across the upper surface. Subtle **rugose folding of the cortex**, scattered **sessile brown apothecia**, and pale tonal variation typical of shaded bark substrates are clearly resolved.

### Apothecia (rare but documented)

These images document **sessile, laminal apothecia** of *Flavoparmelia caperata*, showing **brown discs** and **pale thalline margins** that blend into the surrounding cortex. Apothecia are uncommon in this species, and their presence adds significant diagnostic and documentation value.

---

These traits distinguish *F. caperata* from:

- **Punctelia bolliana / rudecta** — white pseudocyphellae, gray thallus  
- **Physcia species** — much smaller lobes, different sorediation  
- **Flavoparmelia baltimorensis** — saxicolous, distinct chemistry  

---

## Habitat

Common Greenshield favors:

- **Mature hardwoods** in forest interiors and edges  
- **Moderate shade** with consistent humidity  
- Areas of **good to excellent air quality**

Colonies may persist for decades, slowly expanding across bark in rounded, overlapping patches.

---

## Fun Fact

*Flavoparmelia caperata* produces **caperatic acid**, a secondary compound that helps protect the thallus from UV exposure, microbial attack, and long-term environmental stress.
