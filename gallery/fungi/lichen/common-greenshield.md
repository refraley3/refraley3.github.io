# Common Greenshield Lichen

The pale, leafy lobes and black-veined underside identify them as **Common Greenshield Lichen (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)** â€” one of Minnesotaâ€™s most widespread bark lichens. This elm tree has several round, greenish patches on the trunk. 

Lichens do not have roots; nutrients are extracted from the air, making them sensitive to air quality. Their presence indicates **clean air** and healthy forest conditions, thriving especially in shaded or semi-open habitats. 

## Identification
- **Color:** Pale green to yellowish-green, turns brighter when wet.  
- **Form:** Foliose (leaf-like) with broad lobes, slightly wrinkled surface.  
- **Underside:** Black with pale veins and short rhizines.  
- **Substrate:** Elm bark â€” medium texture and neutral pH support good lichen growth.

### ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact
*Flavoparmelia caperata* produces **caperatic acid**, which helps protect it from microbial damage and UV exposure â€” one reason it can live for decades on the same trunk.
