## *Flavoparmelia caperata*

**Common Greenshield Lichen** is a pale green foliose species with **broad, smooth, loosely attached lobes** forming rounded mats on hardwood bark. Its surface is often slightly wrinkled, with **fine pseudocyphellae** dispersed across the thallus, and margins that gently lift to reveal a **pale tan to brown underside with short, simple rhizines**.

This species is a reliable **air-quality indicator**, thriving where long-term atmospheric conditions are clean and stable.

## Description

*Flavoparmelia caperata* is recognized by:

- **Pale green to yellow-green thallus**, brighter when wet  
- **Wide lobes** (typically 3–7 mm), smooth to slightly wrinkled  
- **Pseudocyphellae** scattered across the upper surface  
- **Underside** light brown to tan, with pale rhizines  
- **Foliose growth**, loosely attached except at central points  
- **Absence of isidia or soredia** in most typical forms (though some populations may produce them)

Greenshield forms **discrete foliose rosettes** or broader, merging patches on tree trunks, especially on **oak, maple, elm**, and other mid-textured bark types.

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** Cool pale green; never gray or blue-gray  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, 3–7 mm across  
- **Surface:** Smooth, with gentle folds; pseudocyphellae visible as tiny pale spots  
- **Underside:** Pale brown with simple rhizines  
- **Sorediation:** Generally lacking dense soredia—important distinction from *Physcia* and *Phaeophyscia* species  
- **Attachment:** Loosely foliose, lifting easily at the edges  

These traits distinguish *F. caperata* from:

- **Punctelia bolliana / rudecta** — which have *white pseudocyphellae and a gray thallus*  
- **Physcia species** — much smaller lobes, often heavily sorediate  
- **Flavoparmelia baltimorensis** — typically grows on rock and displays different chemistry

## Habitat

Common Greenshield favors:

- **Mature hardwoods** in forest interiors or edges  
- **Moderate shade** and **consistent humidity**  
- Areas of **good to excellent air quality**  

Colonies may persist for decades, slowly expanding across the bark in rounded, overlapping patches.

## Fun Fact

*Flavoparmelia caperata* produces **caperatic acid**, a protective secondary compound that helps the species withstand UV light, microbial attack, and long-term environmental stress.

## Notes

This page includes **only confirmed diagnostic information** for *Flavoparmelia caperata*.  
Images previously assumed to show this species were revealed to depict **Punctelia bolliana** and have been removed pending correct placement elsewhere on the site.
