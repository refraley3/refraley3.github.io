## *Flavoparmelia caperata*

The **Common Greenshield Lichen** (*Flavoparmelia caperata*) forms wide, cohesive mats across bark, its lobes thick, smooth, and gently uplifted along the edges. **Greenshield in Winter Light** highlights the species’ characteristic **pale green thallus**, dusted with fine pseudocyphellae and edged by rounded margins that curl just enough to reveal a **dark brown, rhizine-lined underside**. Unlike crustose lichens that sit flush against the substrate, Greenshield develops **loose, leafy lobes** that subtly shift with humidity and seasonal moisture.

[Small sunburst-yellow crustose lichens](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/) scattered nearby emphasize the Greenshield’s quiet dominance. Its thick, overlapping lobes create a three-dimensional presence that stands out among thinner foliose neighbors. This colony exemplifies the species’ reputation as a **clean-air indicator** — thriving only where long-term air quality and stable forest conditions allow uninterrupted growth.

Highly sensitive to airborne pollutants, *F. caperata* persists where forests offer **filtered light, moderate humidity, and mature bark structure**. Large, healthy colonies often signal decades of environmental consistency.

The **Greenshield Circle** image shows a near-perfect foliose rosette centered on deeply fissured elm bark, bordered by bright crustose yellows and scattered gray foliose thalli. Its matte surface and calm green tone create a natural focal point against the dark, rugged background.

**Lobe Detail Study** highlights Greenshield’s overlapping, wrinkled lobes, each with faint translucence at the margins. At macro scale, fine granules and a soft sheen emerge, along with the darkening toward the base where rhizines secure the thallus to the bark.

### Twin Colonies

In **Twin Colonies**, two mature rosettes appear on opposite sides of the elm trunk, illustrating how *F. caperata* forms **self-contained disks** rather than spreading continuously. Bright crustose yellows and darker foliose neighbors heighten the Greenshield’s cool, mint-green contrast.

## Identification

- **Color:** Pale green to yellow-green; brightens markedly when wet  
- **Form:** Foliose, with **broad, wavy lobes** and a softly wrinkled surface  
- **Surface:** Dull to slightly glossy, with fine pseudocyphellae  
- **Underside:** Dark brown to black, with pale veins and short rhizines  
- **Substrate:** Elm, maple, oak, and other hardwoods with medium-textured bark  
- **Air Quality Indicator:** Strong presence signals **clean, low-pollution air**

---

## Habitat

Observed in a **mixed hardwood stand** containing elm, oak, and maple. Light shade and steady humidity provide ideal conditions. In cool fall weather, Greenshield retains crisp texture, while neighboring Sunburst and Candleflame lichens intensify in color, sharpening the contrast across the bark.

---

## Fun Fact

*Flavoparmelia caperata* produces **caperatic acid**, a long-lasting defensive compound that protects it from microbes and UV radiation — a key factor in its ability to persist for decades on the same trunk.
