## *Imshaugia placorodia*

## *Family - Parmeliaceae*

**American Starburst (*Imshaugia placorodia*)** is a pale gray foliose lichen easily recognized by its **dense scatter of black pycnidia** across the upper surface. These tiny black dots—its most diagnostic feature—give the thallus a peppered, star-sparked appearance. The lobes are smooth to slightly wrinkled, overlapping, and soft gray to gray-green depending on moisture.

This species grows on hardwood bark throughout northeastern North America, with scattered records farther south and west. It is uncommon but locally frequent in Minnesota’s northern counties, with only a handful of records in the Twin Cities region. The lack of soredia or isidia, combined with the **abundant pycnidia**, distinguishes it immediately from *Physcia*, *Phaeophyscia*, *Punctelia*, and *Flavoparmelia*.

A close look reveals the delicate architecture of coexisting lichens. Each thrives where light, moisture, and bark chemistry allow, creating a natural mosaic that shifts with season and exposure. Together, they form a study in quiet persistence and shared resilience.

The central rosettes exhibit classic **pycnidia-rich surfaces**, giving the thallus its starburst texture. Below, a colony of **[Powdery Shield (*Physcia millegrana*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/)** appears as tiny dusty lobes, emphasizing how much finer and granular Physcia species are compared to the broad, smooth lobes of *Imshaugia*. Surrounding yellow patches of **[Common Sunburst (*Xanthoria parietina*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/)** create strong color contrast, sharpening the cool gray tones of American Starburst.

This colony illustrates several hallmark traits of *Imshaugia placorodia*:  
- **black pycnidia** densely covering the surface  
- **smooth, rounded lobes** with uplifted edges  
- **pale gray coloration**, shifting slightly greener when moist  
- **lack of soredia or isidia**  

Moisture dramatically influences appearance. When dry, the thallus is a muted silver-gray; even a thin layer of dew or snow reveals a faint green cast as the cortex becomes translucent. The Winter Rosette photograph was taken as snow melted on the bark, briefly enriching the color. These rapid shifts are typical of *Imshaugia*.

## Description

*Imshaugia placorodia* forms **loosely attached foliose rosettes** that may occur singly or in large spreading mats. The upper surface is:

- pale gray to blue-gray  
- smooth to slightly wrinkled  
- dotted with **numerous black pycnidia** (the defining feature)

The lower surface is pale to medium brown near the margins, darkening toward the center, with sparse to moderate simple rhizines.

Unlike many gray foliose genera, *Imshaugia* lacks soredia, lacks isidia, and rarely forms apothecia—making the ubiquitous pycnidia especially useful for identification.

The broad, rounded lobes radiate outward in a loose rosette, with diagnostic white pseudocyphellae scattered across the upper surface. Common on hardwoods in the Upper Midwest and often found mixed with smaller gray crustose and foliose species.

This portrait captures the essence of *Imshaugia placorodia*: a pale, soft-textured thallus speckled with innumerable black pycnidia, creating the distinctive starburst pattern that gives the species its common name.

## Habitat

In Minnesota, *Imshaugia placorodia* is found on:

- **elm, oak, maple, birch, and aspen bark**  
- **well-lit to partially shaded exposures**  
- **stable, mature bark** on older trunks and branches  

It favors cool, humid microhabitats but tolerates moderate dryness. Although more frequent in northeastern Minnesota, occasional records appear farther south where suitable forest patches persist.
