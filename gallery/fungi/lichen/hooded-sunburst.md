Hooded Sunburst is a compact, vividly colored sunburst lichen forming small yellow to orange rosettes on bark. The **slightly upturned, hooded lobe tips** give the species a sculpted appearance that becomes especially apparent in close views and under moist conditions.

For identification details and comparison with other similar species, see the **Field Notes** section, [*Xanthomendoza fallax*](/field-notes/lichen/xanthomendoza-fallax/).

## Visual Notes

- Bright yellow to orange coloration  
- Compact, appressed rosette form  
- Distinctive hooded or upturned lobe tips

This close view shows a compact rosette of Hooded Sunburst with **distinctly upturned, hood-like lobe tips**. The curled margins create pockets of shadow and depth, emphasizing the sculpted form of the thallus. Color ranges from lemon yellow to deeper orange toward the center, a contrast that becomes more pronounced under cool, moist conditions.

_A small but intensely colored colony reveals the crisp geometry of hooded lobes against winter bark._  
Camera: Canon EOS 5D Mk IV  
Lens: EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM

A smaller colony highlights the **tight, appressed growth habit** of Hooded Sunburst. The lobes remain short and thick, with tips slightly rolled upward rather than spreading flat. This compact form distinguishes *Xanthomendoza fallax* from larger sunbursts nearby and rewards close inspection at macro scale.

---

## Context

Hooded Sunburst often appears alongside other sunburst lichens, where subtle differences in lobe shape and growth habit distinguish it from larger, more familiar species. Its compact size and sculpted margins make it especially well suited to macro photography, particularly in winter when color saturation is enhanced.
