## Description

*Physcia aipolia*, commonly known as **Hooded Rosette Lichen**, is a foliose lichen with a pale gray to bluish-gray thallus.  
The surface often shows **fine dark spotting**, and the lobes have narrow **dark edges** that enhance its patterned look.

Its most defining trait is its **apothecia**: pale gray centers surrounded by striking **black rims**.  
When colonies are abundant — as on old deciduous bark — they create a stippled constellation of rosettes.

It often grows alongside:

- *Candelaria concolor* (Candleflame Lichen)  
- *Flavoparmelia caperata* (Common Greenshield)  
- *Physcia millegrana* (Powdery Shield)

Its presence is a good indicator of moderate air quality and stable bark chemistry.
