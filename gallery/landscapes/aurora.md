title: Aurora Over Lakeville

### Lights Beneath the Red Sky  
{:.kicker}

A rare geomagnetic storm painted the night sky over Lakeville in vivid red and green.  
For a few hours, the aurora reached deep into the northern United States, transforming quiet suburban yards into unexpected observatories.  
Captured from home, these images record one of the most intense auroral displays in decades — the solar wind brushing Earth’s magnetic field in full color.
