### Exploring Maine’s Working River  
{:.kicker}

The Kennebec River flows from Moosehead Lake to the Gulf of Maine, connecting forests, mills, shipyards, and lighthouses along its winding course. 
Near Bath, history and industry converge — where Doubling Point and Fiddler’s Reach Lights still guide vessels past the Bath Iron Works and toward the open sea.
