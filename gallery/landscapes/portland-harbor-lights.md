title: Portland Harbor Lights, Maine

### Fog and evening light along Maine’s rocky coast.  
{:.kicker}

Captured on a late-spring evening, these images trace the mood of the Maine shoreline from Cape Elizabeth to Portland Harbor. The first series features Portland Head Light, one of New England’s most photographed landmarks, standing watch over the open Atlantic. The mist gradually lifted, revealing the lighthouse in soft evening sun. Nearby, Spring Point Ledge Light marks the entrance to Portland Harbor, its cast-iron tower rising from a granite breakwater. Together, these lights reflect the enduring character of Maine’s maritime landscape, shaped by weather, tide, and time.
