_Morning calm beneath the skyline._  
From the harbor, Boston’s skyline rises in layers of glass and brick — a balance of history and renewal reflected on the still water. The scene captures a brief pause between movement and memory, where the city meets the tide.

_Training ships of the Ocean Classroom Foundation._  
Moored together at the Boston waterfront, the schooners Spirit of Massachusetts, Harvey Gamage, and Westward formed a striking trio of sail-training vessels under the Ocean Classroom Foundation. Each served as a floating classroom for maritime education along the Atlantic coast.
The Harvey Gamage remains active today through the Marine Learning Project, while the Spirit of Massachusetts was later restored and now serves as a dockside restaurant in Kennebunkport, Maine.

### Misty Morning
{:.section-title}

#### Early autumn mist drifts through the wetlands as morning light begins to emerge.  
{:.caption}

Taken on a fog-covered morning in early September, these images capture the stillness of Ritter Farm Park before the sun breaks through. The first shows the beaver pond, where cattails and water plants fade into the haze, and the air feels almost suspended in silence. The second frames the small bridge over a tributary feeding Lake Marion, its structure softened by the lingering fog. Together, they convey a moment between night and day — when the park’s wetlands seem to hold their breath in the muted calm of dawn.

### Morning Light
{:.section-title}

#### Low autumn sun illuminates the prairie and woodland trails in golden light.  

Captured in the early hours after sunrise, these images show the soft interplay of light and texture across the prairie and woodland paths of Ritter Farm Park. The first frame highlights tall grasses and late-season blooms glowing under a clearing sky. The second looks down a wooded trail edged with warm foliage and filtered morning light. Together, they reflect the quiet energy of a fall morning as the landscape shifts from shadow to gold.

### Energy Transition near Kirtland, New Mexico
{:.section-title}

From coal combustion to solar generation on Navajo land in the high desert.  
{:.kicker}

This series traces the changing energy landscape near Kirtland, New Mexico, on land owned by the Navajo Nation. The first image, taken in 2007, shows the coal-fired power plant once operated by Public Service Company of New Mexico. Built in the 1970s, the plant suffered an explosion on July 7, 1977, at 7:07 a.m., which permanently shut down one of its generating units. The facility was later acquired by PacifiCorp, whose grid west of the Rockies remains among the least renewable in the United States. Coal for this and a nearby plant—operated by Arizona Public Service across the range—has long been mined from Navajo lands, generating revenue for the tribe. The following photos document the decommissioning and demolition of the original facility, and a final image looks toward a solar array rising on the same desert plain. Together, they record a slow transition from fossil fuel dependence to renewable generation across the region.

### Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve

Reflections in early light over the wetlands.  
{:.kicker}

Captured at sunrise, this view across the wetlands of Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve shows the first light touching the water’s surface. The stillness of the pond contrasts with the pastel colors of the sky, mirrored across patches of lily pads and reeds. The moment reflects the calm transition between night and morning in one of the region’s most peaceful natural spaces.

### Portland Harbor Lights, Maine
{:.section-title}

Fog and evening light along Maine’s rocky coast.  
{:.kicker}

Captured on a late-spring evening, these images trace the mood of the Maine shoreline from Cape Elizabeth to Portland Harbor. The first series features Portland Head Light, one of New England’s most photographed landmarks, standing watch over the open Atlantic. The mist gradually lifted, revealing the lighthouse in soft evening sun. Nearby, Spring Point Ledge Light marks the entrance to Portland Harbor, its cast-iron tower rising from a granite breakwater. Together, these lights reflect the enduring character of Maine’s maritime landscape, shaped by weather, tide, and time.

### Tumacácori National Historical Park, Arizona
{:.section-title}

The Spanish mission at Tumacácori stands as one of the oldest surviving examples of colonial architecture in the American Southwest. Established in the late 1600s by Jesuit missionaries and later expanded under Franciscan supervision, the mission church reflects centuries of adaptation to climate, culture, and conflict. Its unfinished bell tower, weathered plaster, and hand-formed adobe walls retain the quiet dignity of a structure shaped by both faith and frontier life.
