**Boston Waterfront**  
_Morning calm beneath the skyline._  
From the harbor, Boston’s skyline rises in layers of glass and brick — a balance of history and renewal reflected on the still water. The scene captures a brief pause between movement and memory, where the city meets the tide.

_Training ships of the Ocean Classroom Foundation._  
Moored together at the Boston waterfront, the schooners Spirit of Massachusetts, Harvey Gamage, and Westward formed a striking trio of sail-training vessels under the Ocean Classroom Foundation. Each served as a floating classroom for maritime education along the Atlantic coast.
The Harvey Gamage remains active today through the Marine Learning Project, while the Spirit of Massachusetts was later restored and now serves as a dockside restaurant in Kennebunkport, Maine.

### Misty Morning
{:.section-title}

#### Early autumn mist drifts through the wetlands as morning light begins to emerge.  
{:.caption}

Taken on a fog-covered morning in early September, these images capture the stillness of Ritter Farm Park before the sun breaks through. The first shows the beaver pond, where cattails and water plants fade into the haze, and the air feels almost suspended in silence. The second frames the small bridge over a tributary feeding Lake Marion, its structure softened by the lingering fog. Together, they convey a moment between night and day — when the park’s wetlands seem to hold their breath in the muted calm of dawn.

### Morning Light
{:.section-title}

#### Low autumn sun illuminates the prairie and woodland trails in golden light.  

Captured in the early hours after sunrise, these images show the soft interplay of light and texture across the prairie and woodland paths of Ritter Farm Park. The first frame highlights tall grasses and late-season blooms glowing under a clearing sky. The second looks down a wooded trail edged with warm foliage and filtered morning light. Together, they reflect the quiet energy of a fall morning as the landscape shifts from shadow to gold.
