**Boston Waterfront**  
_Morning calm beneath the skyline._  
From the harbor, Boston’s skyline rises in layers of glass and brick — a balance of history and renewal reflected on the still water. The scene captures a brief pause between movement and memory, where the city meets the tide.

_Training ships of the Ocean Classroom Foundation._  
Moored together at the Boston waterfront, the schooners Spirit of Massachusetts, Harvey Gamage, and Westward formed a striking trio of sail-training vessels under the Ocean Classroom Foundation. Each served as a floating classroom for maritime education along the Atlantic coast.
The Harvey Gamage remains active today through the Marine Learning Project, while the Spirit of Massachusetts was later restored and now serves as a dockside restaurant in Kennebunkport, Maine.

_Monitoring the bend where river meets tide._  
A small white tower and keeper’s house mark the turning point of the Kennebec River, guiding ships past forested banks toward the open sea.
