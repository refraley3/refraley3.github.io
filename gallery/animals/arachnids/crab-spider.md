## *Waiting in Gold*

**A crab spider disguised among the petals.**

This small crab spider sits perfectly still on a yellow wildflower, its color matching the petals so well that most insects never notice until it’s too late. These ambush predators rely on patience and camouflage rather than webs, using sunlight and stillness as part of their trap. Observed on a late-summer morning, the spider’s delicate form contrasts beautifully against the cool tones of the background leaves.
