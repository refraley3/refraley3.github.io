## Description

The red squirrel (*Tamiasciurus hudsonicus*) is a small, energetic rodent native to North America’s coniferous and mixed forests. Known for its bright rusty-red fur, white underbelly, and expressive tail, it is one of the most vocal and territorial squirrels in the region.

These squirrels are famous for caching food — particularly conifer cones and fungi. They often collect mushrooms, carry them up into trees, and hang them on branches to dry before storing them for winter use. This behavior not only sustains them through harsh months but also helps disperse fungal spores, making them an important part of forest ecology.

## Behavior and Habitat

Red squirrels typically inhabit pine, spruce, and fir forests but also adapt to mixed hardwood stands. They are diurnal, active throughout the day, and spend much of their time gathering and defending food stores. Their sharp chattering calls serve as both warnings to rivals and alerts to predators.

In autumn, red squirrels are particularly busy preparing for winter. Their nests (called *dreys*) are constructed from bark, leaves, and moss — often placed high in tree forks for protection and insulation.

## Photography Notes

- **Location:** Forested area with mature pine and oak trees  
- **Lighting:** Soft natural light filtering through foliage  
- **Camera Settings (suggested):**  
  - ISO 800–1600  
  - Shutter speed 1/500s or faster  
  - Aperture f/5.6–f/8  
- **Lens:** Telephoto (200–400mm range recommended)  

Capturing these quick, agile animals requires patience — and sometimes a bit of luck, especially when they pause momentarily with a prized mushroom in tow.
