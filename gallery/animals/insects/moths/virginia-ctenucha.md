### *Ctenucha virginica*

---

The Virginia Ctenucha is one of the most colorful moths in the Upper Midwest. Although classified as a moth, it is diurnal and often mistaken for a butterfly when it flutters low over grasses. The long, feathery antennae help distinguish males, and the orange-and-blue contrast is unmistakable at close range.

### Additional Photos

The moth lifts its dark wings just enough to reveal the iridescent sheen of its thorax, framed by the bold orange collar and elegantly feathered antennae. Caught mid-movement, it looks both vivid and delicate against the wet green blades. Seen from the side, the Virginia Ctenucha reveals its metallic blue body and vivid orange collar peeking between blades of grass. The dark forewings fold neatly along its sides while the pale-edged hindwings trail below, giving a glimpse of the soft gray underside.
