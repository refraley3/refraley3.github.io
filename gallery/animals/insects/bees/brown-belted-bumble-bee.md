### Bombus griseocollis

---

## Unique Trait

The brown-belted bumble bee is easily recognized by the single brown band across the front of its abdomen, contrasting with the otherwise yellow and black coloration. This species is one of the more common bumble bees in eastern and central North America and is a frequent visitor to gardens, fields, and meadows.

## Cultural Note

> "Their gentle nature and tireless work among flowers have made bumble bees enduring symbols of cooperation and industriousness."

## Description

The brown-belted bumble bee is a robust pollinator with dense, fuzzy hair that helps it collect and transport pollen efficiently. Queens are large and mostly black with a golden-brown band, while workers are smaller and display more yellow. Colonies are annual and usually nest in abandoned rodent burrows or grassy clumps.

## Diet

Adults feed primarily on nectar from a wide variety of flowering plants, favoring those with tubular blossoms.  
Larvae are fed a mixture of pollen and nectar stored in small wax pots constructed by the workers.  
This species plays a key role in pollinating native wildflowers and agricultural crops alike.

## Behavior

Brown-belted bumble bees are social insects that live in small colonies. The queen establishes a nest in spring and raises the first brood of workers. These workers then take over foraging and nest maintenance duties while the queen focuses on reproduction. Colonies peak in late summer before dying out in fall, except for new queens.

## Color

They display a mix of black, yellow, and a distinctive brown band on the second abdominal segment, which gives the species its name.

## Wings

Two pairs of translucent wings with a light amber tint provide them with strong, agile flight ideal for hovering near flowers.

## Legs

Their hind legs have large, hairy pollen baskets (corbiculae) used to carry pollen back to the nest.

## Tail

The abdomen ends in a smooth, rounded tip; only females possess a stinger, which is rarely used unless provoked.

## Size

Workers average 11–15 mm in length, with queens reaching up to 20 mm.
