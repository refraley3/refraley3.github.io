title: Bald-faced Hornet
---

## *Dolichovespula maculata*

## Unique Trait

Unlike most yellowjackets, the bald-faced hornet has distinctive white facial markings and builds large, enclosed paper nests high above ground — often in trees or under eaves.

## Description

Despite its name, the bald-faced hornet is actually a type of yellowjacket wasp. It is known for its black body and ivory-white face and markings. These social wasps are highly protective of their nests and can sting repeatedly when threatened. They feed on other insects/bees/ making them beneficial predators, and also consume nectar and tree sap.

## Behavior

Bald-faced hornets are highly social and live in large colonies that can contain hundreds of workers by late summer. They are defensive of their nests and will attack perceived threats aggressively. Workers hunt other insects to feed larvae, while adults often drink nectar and fruit juices.

## Color

These wasps have a glossy black exoskeleton with ivory-white markings on the face, the first antennal segment, thorax, and tail end.

## Wings

They have two pairs of transparent wings with a slight smoky tint, enabling agile flight and hovering capability during foraging.

## Legs

The legs are slender and black, adapted for grasping and manipulating prey.

## Tail

 The “tail” ends in a sharp stinger capable of repeated use.

## Size

Workers measure around 12–15 mm in length, while queens can reach up to 20 mm.
