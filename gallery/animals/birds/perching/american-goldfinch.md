## Scientific Name: *Spinus tristis*

## Description

The American Goldfinch (Spinus tristis) — Minnesota’s vibrant state bird—is a lively, social finch easily recognized by its bright plumage and musical calls. Often seen fluttering among sunflowers and thistles, these birds bring a burst of yellow to meadows and gardens. Males in summer wear dazzling yellow feathers and a black cap, while females and winter birds display softer olive hues.

### Behavior and Feeding

Feeds on seeds while perched; often seen in flocks. Nests late in summer to match seed availability. Primarily seeds from thistle, sunflower, dandelion, and other composites.

Goldfinches remain in flocks until well past the time when other species have formed pairs and are nesting. In the winter they gather in large flocks often with other finches such as redpolls, and Pine Siskins.

## Flight

Undulating flight with a bouncy rhythm

## Nesting

Nests late in summer to match seed availability. Cup of grass, bark strips, and plant down placed in the upright fork of a small sapling or shrub. The nest holds 4 to 5 pale blue eggs.

## Range

Breeds from southern British Columbia east to Newfoundland, and south to California, Utah, southern Colorado, central Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Carolinas. Winters throughout much of the United States.

## Habitat

Weedy fields, gardens, roadsides, orchards
