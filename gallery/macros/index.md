Raindrops become glassy hemispheres, each holding a miniature reflection of the surrounding grasses and autumn colors. **Rain Held Close** reveals the quiet geometry of water gathering on a fallen oak leaf in the moments after a storm at this scale. The leaf’s surface, textured and weathered, turns into a landscape of its own—where droplets cling, merge, and create fleeting patterns that shift with the slightest breeze. In the calm that follows heavy weather, the forest floor offers a world of fine details, often missed but full of subtle brilliance.

**Rain Held Close**  
_A quiet world distilled into droplets._  
After the storm, an oak leaf becomes a basin for the smallest reflections. Beads of rain cling to its surface, forming crystal domes that magnify the colors of grass and autumn debris around them.

**Candleflame in the Company of a Shadow**, its warm yellow lobes erupt from a shadow of [Common Greenshield](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/). The *Candleflame* contrasting with the pale grays of [Powdery Shield](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/) and the muted green-gray tones of [Mealy Shadow](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/). Each species occupies a different microtexture of the elm bark: Candleflame filling cracks with its fine soredia, Powdery Shield forming crisp-edged tiny rosettes, and Mealy Shadow spreading more loosely across the surface. The three together reveal the complexity of lichen communities at sub-millimeter scales.
