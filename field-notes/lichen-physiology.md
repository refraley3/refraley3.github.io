**Shared Bark - The Living Mosaic**{: .tile .title}  
_A winter bark community of color and form - where four lichens share space, light, and time._{: .tile .kicker}  

Lichens possess characteristics that set them apart from plants, fungi, and other organisms.  
Though often described as “plant-like” — with leaf-like lobes or branching structures — lichens are **not plants**. They do not have roots, stems, or vascular tissues, and they do not draw nutrients from the substrate they grow on.

A lichen is a **composite organism**, a stable symbiotic partnership between:
- **fungus (mycobiont)**  
- **alga or cyanobacterium (photobiont)**  

Some lichens have highly organized internal layers; others form a uniform, gelatinous body.  
They absorb **water, minerals, and atmospheric nutrients directly** across their surface.  
When growing on trees, they are **not parasitic** — they use bark only as a physical surface.

## Terminology

**Apothecia**  
Cup- or disk-shaped fruiting bodies where fungal spores (ascospores) are produced.

**Ascospore**  
Sexual fungal spore released from the apothecia.

**Conidia**  
Asexual fungal spores formed in specialized structures, often tiny black dots on the thallus.

**Cortex**  
A protective outer fungal layer covering the upper (and sometimes lower) surface of the thallus.

**Crustose**  
Growth form tightly attached to the substrate; cannot be removed without damage.

**Cyanobacteria**  
Blue-green photobionts capable of nitrogen fixation; present in some lichens (cyanolichens).

**Endolithic**  
Growing partially or fully within rock or mineral substrate.

**Epiphyte**  
Growing on plants (often tree bark) without drawing nutrients from the host.

**Fruticose**  
Branching, shrub-like or hair-like lichens with three-dimensional structure.

**Foliose**  
Leaf-like lichens with distinct lobes and a lower surface.

**Leprose**  
Powdery lichens lacking differentiation into distinct layers.

**Lobe**  
Flattened or elongated projections of foliose lichens.

**Medulla**  
The loose fungal layer beneath the cortex where nutrient and water retention occur.

**Metabolites (Secondary Metabolites)**  
Chemical compounds produced by lichens for protection — responsible for many lichen colors.

**Pycnidia**  
Minute flask-shaped structures producing conidia; appear as tiny dark dots.

**Soredia**  
Powdery reproductive granules containing fungal hyphae + photobiont cells.

**Thallus**  
The entire body of the lichen.

## Anatomy

Typical foliose and fruticose lichens have a layered internal structure:

**Upper Cortex**  
- Protective skin of densely packed fungal cells  
- Provides UV protection and water regulation  

**Photobiont Layer**  
- Green algae or cyanobacteria cells  
- Carries out photosynthesis  
- Often visible as a greenish or bluish layer when broken  

**Medulla**  
- Loose network of fungal hyphae  
- Stores water and nutrients, facilitates gas exchange  

**Lower Cortex (sometimes absent)**  
- Protective underside, often with darker pigmentation  
- May include rhizines  

**Rhizines**  
- Root-like fungal attachments (not true roots)  
- Anchor the lichen to bark, rock, or wood  

**Apothecia / Pycnidia**  
- Reproductive structures on upper surfaces or margins

## Physiology

**Water Uptake**  
- Lichens absorb water **directly through the thallus**.  
- They can desiccate completely and later revive upon rehydration — a key adaptation for survival on bark and rock.

**Photosynthesis**  
- Algal partners use sunlight to produce sugars.  
- Cyanobacteria can additionally **fix atmospheric nitrogen**, enriching the habitat.

**Gas Exchange**  
- Occurs freely across the thallus; lichens lack stomata.

**Growth Rate**  
- Extremely slow (typically 0.5–5 mm per year), depending on species and climate.

**Chemical Production**  
Lichens produce complex secondary metabolites used for:  
- UV protection  
- Anti-bacterial and anti-fungal defense  
- Herbivore deterrence  
- Coloration (yellows, greens, oranges, whites)

## Symbiotic Relationship

The relationship between fungus and photobiont is often described as:  
- **Mutualistic** — both partners benefit  
- **Controlled parasitism** — the fungus controls growth and environment  
- **Obligate dependence** — many lichens cannot survive without their specific partners  

The fungus provides:  
- Structure  
- Moisture retention  
- Mineral absorption  
- Protection from UV and desiccation  

The photobiont provides:  
- Carbohydrates via photosynthesis  
- Nitrogen (if cyanobacteria are present)

Together, they form a single, stable ecological unit.

## Ecology

Lichens are foundational organisms in many ecosystems:

**Substrate Colonizers**  
- First to colonize bare rock, bark, or soil  
- Contribute to rock weathering and soil formation  

**Air Quality Indicators**  
- Sensitive to sulfur dioxide and pollutants  
- Species diversity often correlates with clean air  

**Habitat Providers**  
- Microhabitats for mites, spiders, insect larvae  
- Nesting material for birds  

**Seasonal Activity**  
- Photosynthesis increases during cool, moist periods  
- Many remain active under snow when moisture is high

**Bark Chemistry Preference**  
- Some prefer acidic bark (oak, maple)  
- Others thrive on alkaline or nutrient-rich bark (ash, elm)

Lichens illustrate how fungi, algae, and the environment weave together into long-lived, resilient partnerships.
