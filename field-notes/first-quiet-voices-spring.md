title: First Quiet Voices of Spring
description: Rue Anemone slender stems tremble at the slightes wind, giving their name "windflower."

---

I found this cluster of Rue Anemones in a patch of damp woodland just after rainfall — their petals still glistening with droplets. The forest was still mostly brown, but these flowers lent a faint color to the understory. Their slender stems trembled at the slightest wind, true to their name — “windflower.”

At the season’s edge, Rue Anemone opens its petals before most leaves have returned. Its blooms may last only days, yet they mark the beginning of green in the woodland year. • Size: 1200×800

Two flowers share the same stem, their petals patterned faintly with violet veining. Between them, a droplet rests on a heart-shaped leaf — a single moment of stillness in the forest’s quiet rhythm.
