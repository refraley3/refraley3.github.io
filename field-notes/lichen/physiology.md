**Water Uptake**  
- Lichens absorb water **directly through the thallus**.  
- They can desiccate completely and later revive upon rehydration — a key adaptation for survival on bark and rock.

**Photosynthesis**  
- Algal partners use sunlight to produce sugars.  
- Cyanobacteria can additionally **fix atmospheric nitrogen**, enriching the habitat.

**Gas Exchange**  
- Occurs freely across the thallus; lichens lack stomata.

**Growth Rate**  
- Extremely slow (typically 0.5–5 mm per year), depending on species and climate.

**Chemical Production**  
Lichens produce complex secondary metabolites used for:  
- UV protection  
- Anti-bacterial and anti-fungal defense  
- Herbivore deterrence  
- Coloration (yellows, greens, oranges, whites)
