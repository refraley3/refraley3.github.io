The relationship between fungus and photobiont is often described as:  
- **Mutualistic** — both partners benefit  
- **Controlled parasitism** — the fungus controls growth and environment  
- **Obligate dependence** — many lichens cannot survive without their specific partners  

The fungus provides:  
- Structure  
- Moisture retention  
- Mineral absorption  
- Protection from UV and desiccation  

The photobiont provides:  
- Carbohydrates via photosynthesis  
- Nitrogen (if cyanobacteria are present)

Together, they form a single, stable ecological unit.
