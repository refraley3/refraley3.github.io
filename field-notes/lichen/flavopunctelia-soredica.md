{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Parmeliaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/parmeliaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**Powder-edged Speckled Greenshield** (*Flavopunctelia soredica*) is a pale yellow-green to gray-green foliose lichen notable for abundant white pseudocyphellae (speckling) and powdery soralia concentrated along lobe margins. It commonly colonizes hardwood bark and contributes to mixed-species bark mosaics in a range of light exposures.

## Description

*Flavopunctelia soredica* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** Foliose, forming loose rosettes or irregular patches  
- **Thallus:** Pale yellow-green to gray-green; generally flat to slightly convex  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, often slightly overlapping  
- **Surface features:** Abundant white pseudocyphellae (speckling) scattered across the upper surface  
- **Soralia:** Powdery, white, typically concentrated along lobe margins  
- **Underside:** Dark brown to black with simple rhizines  

Apothecia are uncommon; vegetative reproduction by soredia is the primary means of dispersal.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typical substrates and settings include:
- Hardwood bark (elm, maple, ash, oak)  
- Twigs and small branches  
- Urban trees, parks, and open woodland where light is available

Notes:
- Prefers well-lit bark exposures but tolerates a range of moisture regimes.  
- Often found in mixed communities with foliose *Physcia*, *Flavoparmelia*, and crustose species.

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** Pale yellow-green to gray-green  
- **Form:** Loose, foliose patches or rosettes  
- **Surface:** Distinct white pseudocyphellae; margin-focused powdery soralia  
- **Underside:** Dark, with short, simple rhizines  
- **Reproduction:** Abundant soredia; apothecia rare

### Distinguishing from Similar Species

- **vs. Flavopunctelia flaventior:** Compare soralia distribution and pseudocyphellae density; local notes may apply.  
- **vs. Flavoparmelia caperata (Common Greenshield):** *F. caperata* is smoother and more inflated, lacking white pseudocyphellae.  
- **vs. Physcia millegrana (Powdery Shield):** *P. millegrana* has much smaller lobes and an overall uniformly powder-dusted surface rather than strong marginal soralia.

## Ecology and Notes

**Indicator value:** Moderately tolerant of urban conditions; presence indicates established bark communities and tolerates some air impurity compared with more sensitive species.

**Distribution:** Widespread in temperate North America on hardwoods; frequency varies regionally.

**Reproductive strategy:** Vegetative reproduction via soredia is common; sexual structures are uncommon in field populations.
