### Family: [Teloschistaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/teloschistaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Bare-bottomed Sunburst**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/bare-bottomed-sunburst/) (*Xanthomendoza fulva*) is a vivid yellow to orange foliose lichen commonly found on tree bark in Minnesota. It is distinguished by its **narrow, often ascending lobes**, **granular soredia produced from the lower surface**, and a **white, nearly bare underside lacking true rhizines**.

This page documents field observations used for identification. Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are handled separately in the **Gallery** section, [**Bare-bottomed Sunburst**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/bare-bottomed-sunburst/).

## Description

*Xanthomendoza fulva* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** foliose  
- **Thallus:** yellow to orange-yellow, thin to moderately thick  
- **Lobes:** narrow (c. 0.2–0.6 mm), rounded to finely divided, often ascending at the margins  
- **Surface features:** mealy to granular soredia, primarily along the lower surface edges  
- **Underside:** white to pale, smooth  
- **Attachment:** loose to lightly attached, lacking true rhizines  

Colonies are often irregular and variable, with transitions between granular and more distinctly lobed growth within a single thallus.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typically found on:
- **Tree bark**, especially hardwoods  
- Occasionally on wood; rarely on rock  

Habitats include open woodlands, forest edges, and urban or suburban trees. The species often occurs in nutrient-enriched environments and tolerates human disturbance well.

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** yellow to orange-yellow  
- **Form:** foliose, irregular rosettes  
- **Surface:** sorediate, especially along lower margins  
- **Underside:** white, nearly bare  
- **Attachment:** lacking rhizines  
- **Reproductive structures:** apothecia rare; pycnidia often present  

This is the **diagnostic core** of the species.  
Lower-surface soredia combined with a white, non-rhizinate underside are the most reliable characters.

## Ecology and Notes

This species is highly variable in appearance and often co-occurs with other yellow foliose lichens, contributing to frequent misidentification. Moist or cold-season conditions tend to intensify coloration and make soredia more apparent.

Confirmed Minnesota observations are common and well represented by Research Grade records.
