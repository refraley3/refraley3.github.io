### Family: [Cladoniaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/cladoniaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**British Soldier Lichen** (*Cladonia cristatella*) is one of the most easily recognized lichens in eastern North America, distinguished by its **bright red fruiting bodies** perched atop slender stalks. These vivid apothecia resemble tiny caps or helmets, giving rise to the species’ common name.

It is a characteristic lichen of **decaying wood in moist woodlands**, often appearing in small but visually striking colonies.

## Description

The thallus consists of two parts:
- A **basal squamulose layer** of small, gray-green to pale green scales
- Upright **podetia** (stalks) that terminate in **scarlet to crimson apothecia**

The stalks are typically slender and unbranched, sometimes slightly swollen near the top. Apothecia are smooth to slightly irregular and remain intensely colored even in shaded conditions.

Unlike many *Cladonia* species, *C. cristatella* does **not** produce cups at the tips of the podetia.

## Substrate and Habitat

*Cladonia cristatella* grows primarily on:
- **Decaying wood**, including rotting logs and stumps
- Occasionally on **organic soil** rich in decomposed plant material

It favors **cool, moist, shaded environments**, especially mature forests with abundant fallen wood.

## Identification Notes

Key field characters include:
- **Bright red apothecia** at the tips of slender stalks
- Absence of cup-shaped podetia
- Growth on **rotting wood rather than bare soil**

The species may be confused with **Scarlet-fruited Pixie Cup (*Cladonia coccifera*)**, but that species has **distinct cup-shaped podetia**, whereas *C. cristatella* does not.

## Ecology and Notes

The vivid red coloration of the apothecia is thought to deter herbivory and may provide protection from environmental stress. Like other *Cladonia* species, *C. cristatella* contributes to **nutrient cycling** during wood decomposition.

Because it depends on decaying wood, this species benefits from **natural forest processes** and is less common in heavily managed or disturbed landscapes.
