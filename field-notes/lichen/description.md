A lichen is a **composite organism**, a stable symbiotic partnership between:
- **fungus (mycobiont)**  
- **alga or cyanobacterium (photobiont)**  

Some lichens have highly organized internal layers; others form a uniform, gelatinous body.  

They absorb **water, minerals, and atmospheric nutrients directly** across their surface.  

When growing on trees, they are **not parasitic** — they use bark only as a physical surface.
Lichens possess characteristics that set them apart from plants, fungi, and other organisms.  

Though often described as “plant-like” — with leaf-like lobes or branching structures — lichens are **not plants**. They do not have roots, stems, or vascular tissues, and they do not draw nutrients from the substrate they grow on.
