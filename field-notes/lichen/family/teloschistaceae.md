{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Teloschistaceae** is a large and diverse family of lichens recognized by their **bright yellow, orange, or red coloration**, caused by characteristic **anthraquinone pigments**. Members of this family range from **crustose to foliose or fruticose** forms and are common on **rock, bark, wood, and soil**, especially in **well-lit, exposed habitats**.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus may be **crustose, foliose, fruticose, or squamulose**, often forming thin to moderately thick patches or rosettes. Surfaces may be **smooth, granular, or lobed**, and some species develop radiating or fruticose projections. Color is a defining feature, with thalli ranging from **lemon-yellow and golden orange to deep orange or reddish tones**, sometimes intensifying in strong sunlight.

### Substrate and Habitat

Species in this family grow on a wide range of substrates, including **siliceous and calcareous rock**, **tree bark**, **wood**, **soil**, and occasionally **man-made surfaces** such as concrete. They favor **open, sun-exposed environments** and are common in **coastal, arid, alpine, and urban settings**.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Sexual reproduction is common, and apothecia are often conspicuous and colorful.

- **Apothecia:** Typically **lecanorine**, with a **thalline margin** often matching the thallus color and a **bright orange to red disc**.
- **Asci:** Usually contain **eight spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** **Polarilocular** (two-celled with a thick septum), colorless when young, sometimes darkening slightly with age.

Asexual reproduction is also common, with many species producing **soredia, isidia, or blastidia**.

### Chemistry

Teloschistaceae is chemically distinctive due to abundant **anthraquinone pigments**, responsible for the vivid coloration. Spot tests are often **strong and diagnostic**, especially **K+ purple or red** reactions. Chemistry is a primary tool for species-level identification within the family.

### Ecology and Role

Members of this family are often **sun-loving and pollution-tolerant**, thriving in environments with high light and moderate nutrient input. Some species are common in **coastal bird-perching zones** or urban areas. They contribute to **early substrate colonization** and are important visual components of exposed lichen communities.

### Representative Genera

- **Xanthoria** – foliose species with broad lobes, common on nutrient-rich bark and rock  
- **Caloplaca** – a large and diverse group of mostly crustose species  
- **Rusavskia** – foliose to fruticose species, often on rock in exposed sites  
- **Athallia** – crustose species formerly included in *Caloplaca*

### Similar Lichen Families

Teloschistaceae may be confused with other **yellow or orange lichen families**. **Candelariaceae** also includes bright yellow species but lacks anthraquinone pigments and strong K+ reactions. **Lecanoraceae** contains some yellowish crusts but typically has **less intense coloration** and different chemistry. **Acarosporaceae** may overlap in saxicolous habitats but differs in **growth form, apothecial structure, and spore characteristics**.
