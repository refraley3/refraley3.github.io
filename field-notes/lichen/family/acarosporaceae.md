{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Acarosporaceae** is a family of primarily **crustose, saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichens**, best known for their durability and ability to persist in **dry, exposed, and climatically extreme habitats**. Members of this family are common on bare rock surfaces where few other lichens can establish, often acting as early colonizers.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is usually **crustose** and tightly attached to the substrate, making removal difficult without damaging the rock surface. It is commonly **areolate or rimose**, breaking into polygonal patches as it expands. Colors range from **gray and brown to rust, black, or yellow-green**, with some species showing bright yellow tones due to secondary metabolites.

### Substrate and Habitat

Acarosporaceae species occur primarily on **siliceous or calcareous rock**, including cliffs, boulders, and exposed bedrock. They favor **open, sun-exposed sites** and are especially frequent in **arid, alpine, or continental climates**, though they are widespread in temperate regions as well.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly from the genus *Trebouxia*.

### Reproductive Structures

Sexual reproduction is common and often conspicuous.

- **Apothecia:** Typically **lecideine** (black and lacking a thalline margin), often **sunken into the thallus or individual areoles**. Apothecia may be numerous and densely packed.
- **Asci:** Characteristically **polysporous**, containing many spores per ascus — a defining feature of the family.
- **Ascospores:** **Small, simple, colorless**, and ellipsoid.

Asexual reproductive structures such as soredia or isidia are uncommon in most genera.

### Chemistry

Secondary chemistry is **variable but often limited**. Some species, particularly yellow forms, contain **pulvinic acid derivatives**. Standard lichen spot tests are frequently weak or negative, depending on the species.

### Ecology and Role

Members of Acarosporaceae are highly **stress-tolerant**, surviving prolonged drought, intense solar radiation, and extreme temperature fluctuations. They play an important ecological role as **pioneer species**, contributing to **rock weathering and early soil formation**.

### Representative Genera

- **Acarospora** – the largest and most widespread genus; typically areolate crusts with sunken black apothecia  
- **Sarcogyne** – often dark to black crusts with prominent, crowded apothecia  
- **Pleopsidium** – bright yellow crusts, frequently found in alpine or arid environments

### Similar Crustose Families

Acarosporaceae may be confused with other **rock-dwelling crustose lichen families**, particularly in the field. **Lecanoraceae** also includes many saxicolous crusts but typically has **lecanorine apothecia** with a thalline margin and usually **eight spores per ascus**. **Teloschistaceae** often forms brightly colored yellow or orange crusts but differs chemically and commonly shows **anthraquinone pigments** and distinct spot test reactions. **Rhizocarpaceae** can appear similar in growth form but is characterized by **muriform spores** rather than the small, simple spores of Acarosporaceae.
