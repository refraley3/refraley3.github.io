**Rhizocarpaceae** is a family of predominantly **crustose, saxicolous (rock-dwelling) lichens**, best known for their **areolate thalli**, **black apothecia**, and **muriform ascospores**. Many species form conspicuous mosaics on exposed rock surfaces and are characteristic components of **alpine, arctic, and montane environments**, though they also occur in temperate regions.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is typically **crustose and strongly areolate**, breaking into angular, tile-like patches separated by dark fissures. Individual areoles are often sharply defined and may be flat, convex, or slightly rimmed. Thallus color commonly ranges from **gray and gray-green to yellow-green**, with some species developing darker tones in exposed conditions.

Some species produce striking **map-like patterns**, where pale areoles contrast with black margins or fissures.

### Substrate and Habitat

Members of Rhizocarpaceae grow almost exclusively on **hard rock**, most often **siliceous substrates** such as granite and quartzite. They favor **open, sun-exposed sites** and are especially abundant in **cold or high-elevation habitats**, where they may dominate lichen communities on stable rock faces.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, typically **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Sexual reproduction is common and usually prominent.

- **Apothecia:** Usually **lecideine**, black, and round, often **sunken within or seated between areoles**. The disc is typically flat to slightly convex and sharply delimited.
- **Asci:** Typically contain **eight spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** **Muriform** (divided by both transverse and longitudinal septa), initially colorless but often **darkening with age** — a defining characteristic of the family.

Asexual reproductive structures are uncommon and generally absent.

### Chemistry

Secondary chemistry is **variable** but often limited in diagnostic value. Some species contain **pulvinic acid derivatives**, contributing to yellow-green coloration, but spot test reactions are often weak or inconsistent.

### Ecology and Role

Rhizocarpaceae species are **slow-growing, long-lived lichens** that tolerate **extreme cold, desiccation, and high UV exposure**. Several species are used in **lichenometry** to estimate the age of exposed rock surfaces, reflecting their longevity and steady growth rates. They contribute to **rock weathering** and stabilize early biological communities on bare stone.

### Representative Genera

- **Rhizocarpon** – the best-known genus; includes classic “map lichens”  
- **Buellia** (historically associated, though now placed elsewhere)  
- **Catolechia** – less common, often alpine

### Similar Crustose Families

Rhizocarpaceae may be confused with other **saxicolous crustose families**. **Acarosporaceae** also forms areolate crusts but differs in having **polysporous asci** with many small spores rather than muriform spores. **Lecanoraceae** typically has **lecanorine apothecia** with thalline margins and simple spores. **Teloschistaceae** may overlap in color but is distinguished by **anthraquinone pigments**, strong chemical reactions, and non-muriform spores.
