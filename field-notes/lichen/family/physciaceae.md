**Physciaceae** is a diverse family of lichens composed mainly of **small foliose and crustose species**, with occasional fruticose forms. Members of this family are common on **tree bark, wood, and rock**, especially in **open, well-lit habitats**, and include many species frequently encountered in urban and suburban environments.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is typically **foliose**, forming **small, thin rosettes** with narrow lobes, though many species are **crustose or squamulose**. Lobes are often **appressed to adnate**, sometimes with **powdery or granular surfaces**. Thallus colors range from **gray and blue-gray to greenish-gray or brown**, occasionally with darker margins.

The lower surface is usually **pale to dark brown or black**, often bearing **simple rhizines** or lacking rhizines entirely in some crustose forms.

### Substrate and Habitat

Physciaceae species grow on **tree bark, wood, and rock**, with some species favoring nutrient-enriched substrates. They are especially common in **open woodlands, forest edges, roadside trees, and urban areas**, and tolerate **moderate air pollution** better than many macrolichen families.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Reproductive structures are often present and useful for identification.

- **Apothecia:** Typically **lecanorine or biatorine**, with a thalline margin that may be reduced or absent; discs are usually **dark brown to black**.
- **Asci:** Usually contain **eight spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** Characteristically **brown and septate** (often one-septate), a key feature separating Physciaceae from many similar foliose families.

Asexual reproduction is common, with many species producing **soredia, isidia, or granular propagules**.

### Chemistry

Secondary chemistry in Physciaceae is **variable** but generally less complex than in Parmeliaceae. Spot test reactions are often **weak or inconsistent**, though some species show diagnostic responses. Chemistry is usually of secondary importance compared to morphology and spore characteristics.

### Ecology and Role

Physciaceae includes many **ecologically flexible species** that tolerate **disturbance, nutrient enrichment, and moderate pollution**. They are important components of early successional lichen communities on bark and rock and often dominate urban lichen floras.

### Representative Genera

- **Physcia** – common foliose lichens with narrow lobes and white pruina on apothecia  
- **Phaeophyscia** – foliose species with darker thalli and brown spores  
- **Physconia** – foliose species with broader lobes and well-developed rhizines  
- **Buellia** – primarily crustose species, many saxicolous or corticolous

### Similar Lichen Families

Physciaceae may be confused with other **small foliose lichen families**. **Parmeliaceae** species are typically larger, have more complex chemistry, and produce **simple, colorless spores**. **Candelariaceae** includes yellow species but differs in spore color and chemistry. **Teloschistaceae** shares tolerance for exposed habitats but is distinguished by **bright anthraquinone pigments** and different spore morphology.
