### Parmeliaceae

{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Parmeliaceae** is one of the **largest and most diverse families of lichens**, composed primarily of **foliose species**, with a smaller number of **fruticose and crustose forms**. Members of this family are among the most familiar macrolichens on **tree bark and rock**, especially in **temperate and boreal regions**, and include many ecologically important and easily recognized taxa.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is typically **foliose**, forming flat to loosely attached lobes that are **appressed to loosely adnate**. Lobes may be narrow or broad, rounded or elongate, and often form **rosettes or overlapping mats**. Surface texture ranges from smooth to wrinkled or ridged, and colors commonly include **gray, blue-gray, greenish-gray, yellow-green, or brownish tones**.

The underside is usually **distinctly different in color**, often **black or dark brown**, and bears **rhizines** that anchor the thallus to the substrate.

### Substrate and Habitat

Parmeliaceae species grow on **tree bark, wood, and rock**, with some species favoring one substrate strongly. They occur in a wide range of habitats, from **moist forests to open, exposed woodlands and rocky outcrops**, and are especially abundant in **clean-air environments**.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Reproductive features vary widely across the family.

- **Apothecia:** Usually **lecanorine**, with a thalline margin and a brown to black disc; apothecia may be common, rare, or absent depending on species.
- **Asci:** Typically contain **eight spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** **Simple, colorless**, ellipsoid to oblong.

Asexual reproduction is very common, with many species producing **soredia, isidia, pustules, or lobules**, which are often essential for field identification.

### Chemistry

Secondary chemistry is **highly diverse and taxonomically important** in Parmeliaceae. Numerous **lichen acids** are present, and spot tests (K, C, KC, P, UV) are frequently **strong and diagnostic**. Chemical differences are often critical for distinguishing closely related species.

### Ecology and Role

Members of Parmeliaceae are **ecologically significant macrolichens**, contributing to **nutrient cycling**, **habitat structure**, and **food sources** for invertebrates and wildlife. Many species are sensitive to air pollution and are widely used as **bioindicators of air quality**.

### Representative Genera

- **Parmelia** – classic foliose lichens with broad lobes and simple rhizines  
- **[Flavoparmelia](/field-notes/lichen/common-greenshield/)** – yellow-green foliose species, often on bark  
- **Hypogymnia** – hollow-lobed lichens, common on conifers  
- **Punctelia** – foliose species with white pseudocyphellae  
- **Usnea** – fruticose “beard lichens” with a central cord

### Similar Lichen Families

Parmeliaceae may be confused with other **foliose lichen families**. **Physciaceae** often has smaller, thinner thalli and different chemistry, with spores that are typically septate. **Cetrariaceae** includes foliose to fruticose species but differs in growth form and reproductive traits. **Lobariaceae** contains larger, softer foliose lichens that favor moist, old-growth forests and often have different photobionts or internal structures.
