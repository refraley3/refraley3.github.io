{: style="text-align: center;"}

**Lecanoraceae** is a large and diverse family of lichens, composed mainly of **crustose species**, with a smaller number of **foliose forms**. Members of this family are among the most commonly encountered lichens on **rock, bark, and wood**, and they occur across a wide range of habitats from forests to open, exposed sites.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus is most often **crustose**, varying from thin and smooth to thick, cracked, or areolate. Some species form **well-defined rosettes**, while others appear as irregular crusts. Colors range widely and include **white, gray, pale green, yellow-green, brown, or orange-tinged**, often influenced by secondary chemistry and exposure.

A minority of genera within the family produce **foliose or squamulose thalli**, but the crustose habit dominates.

### Substrate and Habitat

Lecanoraceae species grow on a broad range of substrates, including **siliceous and calcareous rock**, **tree bark**, **wood**, and occasionally soil. They occupy habitats ranging from **shaded forests to exposed rock outcrops**, making them ecologically versatile and geographically widespread.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Sexual reproduction is frequent and often conspicuous, making this family comparatively approachable for field identification.

- **Apothecia:** Typically **lecanorine**, with a **thalline margin** that is the same color and texture as the thallus, surrounding a usually brown to black disc. Apothecia are often round and well-defined.
- **Asci:** Usually contain **eight spores per ascus**, in contrast to polysporous families such as Acarosporaceae.
- **Ascospores:** **Simple, colorless, ellipsoid to oblong**, and generally larger than those of Acarosporaceae.

Asexual structures such as **soredia and isidia** are common in many genera and are frequently useful field characters.

### Chemistry

Secondary metabolites are **common and diverse** in Lecanoraceae. Spot tests often yield **clear diagnostic reactions** (e.g., K+, C+, KC+, or UV+), and chemistry is an important tool for species-level identification. Compounds may influence thallus color, especially in yellow or greenish species.

### Ecology and Role

Lecanoraceae includes many **early colonizers** of rock and bark, as well as long-lived, stable components of mature lichen communities. Species in this family contribute to **substrate weathering**, nutrient cycling, and provide microhabitats for invertebrates and other organisms.

### Representative Genera

- **Lecanora** – the type genus; highly variable crustose species with classic lecanorine apothecia  
- **Protoparmeliopsis** – often saxicolous species formerly included in *Lecanora*  
- **Tephromela** – thick crusts with contrasting apothecia, often on rock  
- **Myriolecis** – a segregate group with small, numerous apothecia

### Similar Crustose Families

Lecanoraceae can resemble several other crustose lichen families. **Acarosporaceae** differs in having **lecideine apothecia** and **many spores per ascus**, rather than lecanorine margins and eight spores. **Teloschistaceae** often overlaps in color but is distinguished by **anthraquinone pigments** and strong orange or yellow tones. **Rhizocarpaceae** may appear similar on rock but typically has **muriform, darkening spores** and more strongly areolate thalli.
