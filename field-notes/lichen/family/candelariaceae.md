**Candelariaceae** is a family of mostly **small, yellow to yellow-green lichens**, recognized by their **bright coloration**, **thin thalli**, and frequent occurrence on **tree bark and wood**. Members of this family are especially noticeable in the field due to their vivid color, even though individual thalli are often small and delicate.

### Growth Form and Thallus

The thallus ranges from **crustose to foliose**, sometimes appearing **leprose or squamulose**. Lobes, when present, are typically **narrow, thin, and fragile**, often forming small rosettes or irregular patches. The surface is usually smooth to finely granular.

Color is one of the most distinctive features of the family: thalli are typically **bright yellow, lemon-yellow, or yellow-green**, a result of characteristic secondary compounds.

### Substrate and Habitat

Candelariaceae species occur mainly on **tree bark and wood**, occasionally on rock. They are common in **open woodlands, forest edges, and urban or suburban environments**, often favoring **nutrient-enriched or slightly disturbed substrates**.

### Photobiont

The photobiont is a **green alga**, most commonly **Trebouxia**.

### Reproductive Structures

Reproductive structures vary among genera and species.

- **Apothecia:** When present, apothecia are usually **lecanorine**, with a **yellow to pale margin** and a slightly darker yellow or orange disc. Apothecia are often small and may be sparse or absent.
- **Asci:** Typically contain **eight spores per ascus**.
- **Ascospores:** **Simple, colorless**, ellipsoid to oblong.

Many species reproduce primarily by **asexual means**, producing abundant **soredia or granular propagules**, which can give the thallus a powdery or leprose appearance.

### Chemistry

Members of Candelariaceae contain **pulvinic acid derivatives**, responsible for their bright yellow coloration. Spot tests are often **K− or weak**, but the intense color is usually sufficient for family-level recognition in the field.

### Ecology and Role

Candelariaceae species are generally **fast-growing and short-lived**, thriving in **well-lit environments** with moderate nutrient availability. They are often among the first lichens to colonize young bark or exposed wood and can serve as indicators of **increased light or mild nutrient enrichment**.

### Representative Genera

- **Candelaria** – small foliose to squamulose species with narrow lobes  
- **Candelariella** – primarily crustose species, often forming bright yellow patches on bark or rock

### Similar Lichen Families

Candelariaceae may be confused with other **yellow lichen families**. **Teloschistaceae** also includes bright yellow to orange species but is distinguished by **anthraquinone pigments**, strong spot test reactions (often K+ purple), and frequently more robust thalli. **Lecanoraceae** includes some yellowish crusts but typically lacks the intense lemon-yellow coloration and pulvinic acid chemistry. **Acarosporaceae** may overlap in color on rock but differs in growth form, ecology, and polysporous asci.
