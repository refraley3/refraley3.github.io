## *Punctelia rudecta*

### Family: [Parmeliaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/parmeliaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**Rough Speckled Shield** (*Punctelia rudecta*) is a **common foliose lichen** found on tree bark throughout much of eastern and central North America. It forms **loosely attached rosettes** with **broad, rounded lobes** and a **gray to blue-gray thallus**, often contributing significantly to mature bark-lichen communities.


This page documents field observations used for identification. Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are handled separately in the **Gallery** section, [**Rough Speckled Shield**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/rough-speckled-shield/).

## Identification

- **Growth form:** Foliose  
- **Thallus color:** Pale gray to blue-gray  
- **Lobes:** Broad, rounded, typically overlapping  
- **Surface texture:** Slightly roughened or matte, sometimes appearing faintly speckled  
- **Lower surface:** Black to dark brown with pale margins  
- **Rhizines:** Simple to sparsely branched  
- **Reproductive structures:** Apothecia uncommon; soredia typically absent or sparse  

The overall impression is of a **coarse, sturdy foliose lichen**, larger and thicker than most *Physcia* species.

## Similar Species

**Eastern Speckled Shield (*Punctelia bolliana*)**  
Often confused with *P. rudecta*, but typically shows **more distinct pale spotting** and a **slightly smoother thallus**. Separation can be subtle and may require close inspection or chemical tests.

**Physcia and Phaeophyscia species**  
Usually **smaller**, with **narrower lobes** and a more delicate appearance. These species often grow intermixed with *Punctelia* but do not form large, dominant rosettes.

**Other Parmeliaceae**  
Several gray foliose lichens may appear similar at a glance, but *Punctelia rudecta* stands out by its **size, lobe breadth, and subdued surface texture**.

## Habitat and Distribution

Rough Speckled Shield is most often found on:

- **Tree trunks and large branches**
- **Hardwoods**, occasionally conifers
- **Well-lit to moderately shaded sites**

It tolerates a wide range of conditions and is frequently encountered in **urban, suburban, and natural woodland settings**.

## Notes

Because *Punctelia rudecta* commonly grows in **mixed-species colonies**, careful attention to **lobe size, texture, and overall growth form** helps avoid confusion. When uncertain, comparison with confirmed *Punctelia* specimens or consultation with regional keys is recommended.
