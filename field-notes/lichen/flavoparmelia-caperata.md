## *Flavoparmelia caperata*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Parmeliaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/parmeliaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Common Greenshield**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/) (*Flavoparmelia caperata*) is a pale yellow-green foliose lichen forming rounded rosettes on hardwood bark. It is one of the most frequently encountered members of *Flavoparmelia* in Minnesota and serves as a useful reference species for recognizing the genus as a whole.

---

### Diagnostic Overview

*Flavoparmelia caperata* is characterized by:

- **Thallus:** pale yellow-green to green-gray (especially in shade)
- **Growth form:** foliose, loosely adnate, forming discrete rosettes or merging patches
- **Lobes:** broad, rounded, typically **5–13 mm** wide; smooth to gently rugose
- **Surface:** laminally sorediate; soredia granular to wart-like, often diffuse
- **Isidia:** absent
- **Underside:** black centrally, grading to brown and naked toward margins
- **Rhizines:** simple, black, denser toward the center
- **Apothecia:** rare but documented; laminal, sessile, brown-disc with pale thalline margin

---

### Field Recognition Notes

In the field, *F. caperata* is often recognized by its **soft, matte yellow-green surface**, **broad lobes**, and **laminal sorediation** rather than marginal structures. Colonies frequently appear as **isolated rosettes** scattered across mature hardwood trunks rather than as continuous sheets.

Color perception varies with lighting conditions. Specimens photographed in low light or twilight may appear cooler (blue-shifted). Reliable color assessment benefits from comparison across multiple lighting conditions.

---

### Chemistry

- **Medulla:** K+ bright yellow (caperatic acid)

While chemical testing confirms identification, *F. caperata* is usually identifiable visually when mature.

### Apothecia (Uncommon but Significant)

<div class="grid" role="list" style="margin-top: 20px;">

<div class="tile" style="padding: 10px; text-align: left">

Although primarily sorediate, *Flavoparmelia caperata* occasionally produces **laminal apothecia**. These are:

- Sessile
- Brown-disc
- Surrounded by a pale thalline margin
- Embedded directly in the upper cortex

The presence of apothecia is uncommon and provides valuable documentation of sexual reproduction in this species.

### Comparison With Similar Taxa

*Flavoparmelia caperata* may be confused with the following foliose lichens:

- **Punctelia bolliana / P. rudecta**  
  Blue-gray thallus with **white pseudocyphellae**; apothecia more common.

- **Physcia spp.**  
  Smaller rosettes, narrower lobes, different sorediation patterns; underside pale.

- **Flavoparmelia baltimorensis**  
  Saxicolous (rock-dwelling); chemically and ecologically distinct.

These comparisons are most reliable when thallus underside and sorediation patterns are examined.

---

### Habitat and Ecology

- **Substrate:** hardwood bark (oak, maple, elm common)
- **Light:** partial shade to filtered sun
- **Moisture:** consistent humidity preferred
- **Indicator value:** often more abundant and better developed in areas of **good air quality**

Colonies may persist for decades, expanding slowly across bark surfaces.

### Notes on Genus Context

This species represents a typical expression of *Flavoparmelia* in Minnesota and aligns closely with genus-level traits described in regional field guides, including Tanner Barnharst’s *Minnesota Lichen Guide* (2025). The genus is characterized by yellow-green foliose thalli lacking pseudocyphellae and bearing laminal soredia.
