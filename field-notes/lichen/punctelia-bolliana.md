## *Punctelia bolliana*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Parmeliaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/parmeliaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Eastern Speckled Shield**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/eastern-speckled-shield/) (*Punctelia bolliana*) is a medium-sized foliose lichen recognized by its **distinct white maculae (speckles)** scattered across a **gray-green to olive thallus**. It is a frequent and often overlooked inhabitant of **hardwood bark** in eastern North America, including much of Minnesota. When fresh and hydrated, colonies can appear vividly green, especially in cool, humid conditions.

This page documents field observations used for identification. Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are handled separately in the **Gallery** section, [**Eastern Speckled Shield**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/eastern-speckled-shield/).

## Description

The thallus is **foliose**, tightly adnate to the substrate, forming rounded to irregular rosettes that may coalesce into larger patches.

- **Upper surface:** pale gray-green to olive; smooth to weakly wrinkled  
- **Maculae:** abundant, irregular white flecking across the thallus; a defining feature of the genus  
- **Lobes:** rounded, overlapping, typically **4–10 mm** wide  
- **Lower surface:** black centrally with paler margins  
- **Rhizines:** simple to sparsely branched  

Colonies often appear healthiest and most colorful during damp weather, when green tones intensify.

## Apothecia and Reproduction

Apothecia are **frequent and often numerous** in mature colonies.

- **Discs:** olive-green to brownish-olive when fresh; darkening with age or drying  
- **Margins:** thalline, persistent, often slightly paler than the disc  

The olive coloration of fresh apothecia can be confusing when compared to guide descriptions that emphasize brown tones based on dried or herbarium material.

Vegetative reproduction occurs through **soredia**, though these may be sparse or inconspicuous compared to some related species.

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** gray-green to olive, often greener when hydrated  
- **Surface:** conspicuous white maculae  
- **Form:** foliose, tightly attached rosettes  
- **Apothecia:** common; olive-toned when fresh  
- **Substrate:** hardwood bark  

This combination of **maculate surface, olive-green tones, and frequent apothecia** is the most reliable way to recognize *Punctelia bolliana* in the field.

## Similar Species

**Rough Speckled Shield (*Punctelia rudecta*)**  
- Typically grayer overall  
- Apothecia often less abundant  
- Maculae may appear weaker or less sharply defined  

Fresh field material of *P. bolliana* is best separated by its **green-olive coloration, abundant maculae, and frequent apothecia** on hardwood bark.

---

## Habitat and Ecology

- **Substrate:** hardwood bark  
- **Habitat:** woodlands, forest edges, urban trees  
- **Distribution:** eastern North America; widespread in Minnesota  

The species tolerates a range of light conditions and is commonly found at eye level on mature trees.

## Ecology and Notes

Fresh, hydrated specimens may appear greener and more vibrant than expected from printed guides or herbarium images. Close inspection of maculae and apothecia color in the field provides more reliable identification cues than color descriptions alone.
