Typical foliose and fruticose lichens have a layered internal structure:

**Upper Cortex**  
- Protective skin of densely packed fungal cells  
- Provides UV protection and water regulation  

**Photobiont Layer**  
- Green algae or cyanobacteria cells  
- Carries out photosynthesis  
- Often visible as a greenish or bluish layer when broken  

**Medulla**  
- Loose network of fungal hyphae  
- Stores water and nutrients, facilitates gas exchange  

**Lower Cortex (sometimes absent)**  
- Protective underside, often with darker pigmentation  
- May include rhizines  

**Rhizines**  
- Root-like fungal attachments (not true roots)  
- Anchor the lichen to bark, rock, or wood  

**Apothecia / Pycnidia**  
- Reproductive structures on upper surfaces or margins
