Lichens are foundational organisms in many ecosystems:

**Substrate Colonizers**  
- First to colonize bare rock, bark, or soil  
- Contribute to rock weathering and soil formation  

**Air Quality Indicators**  
- Sensitive to sulfur dioxide and pollutants  
- Species diversity often correlates with clean air  

**Habitat Providers**  
- Microhabitats for mites, spiders, insect larvae  
- Nesting material for birds  

**Seasonal Activity**  
- Photosynthesis increases during cool, moist periods  
- Many remain active under snow when moisture is high

**Bark Chemistry Preference**  
- Some prefer acidic bark (oak, maple)  
- Others thrive on alkaline or nutrient-rich bark (ash, elm)

Lichens illustrate how fungi, algae, and the environment weave together into long-lived, resilient partnerships.
