## *Candelaria concolor*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Candelariaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/candelariaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Candleflame**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/) (*Candelaria concolor*) is a small, vivid yellow foliose lichen forming scattered patches or loose clusters on tree bark. Its powdery surface and soft, glowing color give it a flame-like appearance, especially noticeable in winter or under moist conditions.

This page documents field observations used for identification. Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are handled separately in the **Gallery** section, [**Candleflame**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/).

## Description

*Candelaria concolor* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** foliose to weakly squamulose  
- **Thallus:** bright lemon-yellow to yellow-orange, thin and delicate  
- **Lobes:** very narrow, ribbon-like, often irregular or poorly defined  
- **Surface features:** densely sorediate; soredia fine and powdery, covering most of the upper surface  
- **Underside:** pale to white  
- **Rhizines:** simple, white, sparse to moderately developed  
- **Attachment:** loosely attached  

Colonies are typically small and fragmented, often appearing as scattered flecks rather than continuous rosettes.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typical substrates and settings include:

- **Bark**, especially hardwoods  
- Occasionally on decaying wood  

Habitats include open woodlands, forest edges, and urban trees. The species tolerates a wide range of light conditions and is often abundant in nutrient-enriched environments.

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** bright, uniform yellow  
- **Form:** small, delicate foliose patches  
- **Surface:** strongly powdery due to dense soredia  
- **Underside:** pale with simple white rhizines  
- **Reproductive structures:** apothecia rare or absent  
- **Chemistry:** typically not required for identification  

The combination of **fine powdery soredia**, **very narrow lobes**, and **small thallus size** reliably separates *Candelaria concolor* from larger yellow foliose lichens.

## Ecology and Notes

*Candelaria concolor* is often one of the first yellow lichens to colonize young or disturbed bark surfaces. Its small size and delicate structure make it easy to overlook unless viewed closely. Colonies may persist as scattered patches rather than expanding into large, cohesive thalli.

Research Grade observations are common across Minnesota, reflecting the species’ tolerance of a range of environmental conditions.
