## *Xanthomendoza ulophyllodes*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Teloschistaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/teloschistaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**Powdery Sunburst Lichen** (*Xanthomendoza ulophyllodes*) is a bright yellow to orange foliose lichen distinguished from other Minnesota sunbursts by its **well-developed lower surface with conspicuous white rhizines**. These attachment structures are the most reliable field character separating it from superficially similar species.

This page documents **Research Grade observations** on iNaturalist using photos **E21A8109-8136** and **E21A8111A**. Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are handled separately in the [Gallery](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-sunburst/).

This species is less frequently encountered than *Xanthomendoza fulva* but can form robust, visually striking colonies where conditions are favorable.

## Description

The thallus is **foliose and moderately thick**, forming irregular rosettes or spreading patches. Lobes are **broad, uneven, and often somewhat inflated**, with margins that may curl or lift slightly from the substrate.

The upper surface is **yellow to yellow-orange**, frequently appearing **powdery or granular** due to abundant soredia. Apothecia may be present but are often sparse or absent in heavily sorediate specimens.

The lower surface is pale and bears **distinct white rhizines**, frequently **branched or tufted**, which anchor the lichen firmly to bark.

## Substrate and Habitat

*Xanthomendoza ulophyllodes* is typically found on:
- **Tree bark**, especially hardwoods  
- Trunks and branches in **open to lightly wooded settings**

It often grows as a **dominant patch** rather than being tightly interwoven with other lichens, giving colonies a more self-contained appearance.

## Identification Notes

Key diagnostic features include:

- **True rhizines** visible along the lower surface or emerging beneath lobe margins  
- **Powdery, sorediate upper surface**  
- **Thicker, more three-dimensional thallus** than most other sunbursts  

This species is most commonly confused with **Bare-bottomed Sunburst (*Xanthomendoza fulva*)**, which:
- Lacks true rhizines  
- Is more thinly attached to the substrate  
- Often grows embedded in mixed lichen communities  

Care should be taken not to confuse rhizines with **moss rhizoids, bark fibers, or fungal hyphae**, which may appear as white threads but do not originate from the lichen’s lower surface.

## Ecology and Notes

Like other members of the Teloschistaceae, *Xanthomendoza ulophyllodes* contains protective pigments that allow it to tolerate high light exposure. Its rhizinate attachment suggests a preference for **more stable bark substrates**, where firmer anchoring provides an advantage.

Confirmed observations in Minnesota are less common than those of *X. fulva*, making well-documented records particularly valuable.
