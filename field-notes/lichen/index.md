## Lichen Field Notes

This section is a working field notebook focused on the observation and identification of lichens through photography, comparison, and repeated field encounters.

The emphasis here is on **genus-level recognition** and **diagnostic patterns**—growth form, substrate, color, and reproductive structures—rather than definitive species determination. In many cases, species-level identification from photographs alone is uncertain, and that uncertainty is preserved rather than resolved prematurely.

Content in this section may include:
- Comparative notes between similar genera or species  
- Field observations recorded across seasons and locations  
- Identification frameworks drawn from regional field guides and herbarium references  
- Provisional or evolving identifications  

This material is intentionally separated from the Gallery.  
The Gallery presents lichens as photographic subjects; these field notes explore them as biological organisms.

Both perspectives inform one another.

### Orientation

These notes are organized around form and comparison rather than a complete species list.
