**Apothecia**  
Cup- or disk-shaped fruiting bodies where fungal spores (ascospores) are produced.

**Ascospore**  
Sexual fungal spore released from the apothecia.

**Conidia**  
Asexual fungal spores formed in specialized structures, often tiny black dots on the thallus.

**Cortex**  
A protective outer fungal layer covering the upper (and sometimes lower) surface of the thallus.

**Crustose**  
Growth form tightly attached to the substrate; cannot be removed without damage.

**Cyanobacteria**  
Blue-green photobionts capable of nitrogen fixation; present in some lichens (cyanolichens).

**Endolithic**  
Growing partially or fully within rock or mineral substrate.

**Epiphyte**  
Growing on plants (often tree bark) without drawing nutrients from the host.

**Fruticose**  
Branching, shrub-like or hair-like lichens with three-dimensional structure.

**Foliose**  
Leaf-like lichens with distinct lobes and a lower surface.

**Leprose**  
Powdery lichens lacking differentiation into distinct layers.

**Lobe**  
Flattened or elongated projections of foliose lichens.

**Medulla**  
The loose fungal layer beneath the cortex where nutrient and water retention occur.

**Metabolites (Secondary Metabolites)**  
Chemical compounds produced by lichens for protection — responsible for many lichen colors.

**Pycnidia**  
Minute flask-shaped structures producing conidia; appear as tiny dark dots.

**Soredia**  
Powdery reproductive granules containing fungal hyphae + photobiont cells.

**Thallus**  
The entire body of the lichen.
