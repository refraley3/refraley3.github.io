## *Physcia stellaris*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Physciaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/physciaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

**Star Rosette Lichen** (*Physcia stellaris*) is a compact, distinctive foliose lichen commonly forming gray rosettes marked by characteristic **white-rimmed apothecia**. These pale, elevated margins sharply contrast with darker disc centers, creating a subtle starburst pattern that makes *P. stellaris* one of the most easily recognized bark-dwelling *Physcia* species. It thrives in areas with clean to moderately clean air and frequently co-occurs with related foliose lichens.

## Description

*Physcia stellaris* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** Foliose, forming compact, evenly rounded rosettes several centimeters across  
- **Thallus:** Pale gray to blue-gray; sometimes with a faint frost-like bloom  
- **Lobes:** Small (0.5–1.5 mm), rounded, overlapping, slightly pruinose; edges smooth or gently upturned  
- **Surface features:** Lobes often appear dusted or slightly powdered; lecanorine apothecia abundant and highly conspicuous  
- **Apothecia:** **White-margined** (pale rims), highly abundant; disc centers gray to dark brown; the most diagnostic feature  
- **Underside:** Pale to light brown, with short simple rhizines  
- **Attachment:** Firmly appressed via rhizines  

The species is characterized by evenly distributed small lobes arranged in overlapping rosette patterns and the abundance of **lecanorine apothecia with distinctive pale rims**. These white-margined discs are often the first field mark noticed, appearing as tiny white rings before the rosette structure itself becomes apparent.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typical substrates and settings include:
- **Hardwood bark** (elm, maple, ash, oak)  
- **Twigs and small branches**  
- **Weathered fence posts and rails**  
- Occasionally on rock with bark lichen communities  

*Physcia stellaris* prefers **open or partially shaded habitats** with good air circulation. It is commonly associated with moderately clean atmospheric conditions and often co-occurs with:
- [Candleflame (*Candelaria concolor*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/candleflame/)  
- [Common Greenshield (*Flavoparmelia caperata*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-greenshield/)  
- [Common Sunburst (*Xanthoria parietina*)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/common-sunburst/)  
- [Physcia millegrana (Powdery Shield)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/powdery-shield/)  
- [Phaeophyscia species (Mealy Shadow)](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/)

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** Pale gray to blue-gray, often with faint frost-like surface bloom  
- **Form:** Tidy, rounded foliose rosettes; lobes regular and evenly overlapping  
- **Surface:** Slightly pruinose (frosted appearance); lacking abundant soredia  
- **Apothecia:** Abundant, lecanorine, with **pale or white rims**—the diagnostic feature  
- **Underside:** Pale to light brown; short, simple rhizines visible at attachment points  
- **Lobe size:** Small (0.5–1.5 mm) and regular  
- **Chemistry:** Typically K–, C–, KC–, P–  

### Distinguishing from Similar Species

**vs. *Physcia aipolia* (Hooded Rosette)**  
- *P. aipolia* has more contrasting dark spotting and **dark-rimmed** apothecia (not pale-rimmed)  
- *P. aipolia* lobes often appear more irregular with finer maculae  
- **Star Rosette:** White-rimmed apothecia, more regular rosette form, lighter overall appearance  

**vs. *Physcia millegrana* (Powdery Shield)**  
- *P. millegrana* has much smaller lobes (0.2–1.0 mm) and uniformly powder-dusted surface  
- *P. millegrana* lacks crisp apothecial architecture; apothecia are rare  
- **Star Rosette:** Larger lobes, crisp white-rimmed apothecia, less uniformly dusted surface  

**vs. *Phaeophyscia orbicularis* (Mealy Shadow)**  
- *Phaeophyscia* is notably darker with granular, more roughened margins  
- *Phaeophyscia* lacks white-rimmed apothecia; apothecia have dark rims  
- *Phaeophyscia* thallus appears soot-toned rather than pale gray  
- **Star Rosette:** Distinctly paler, with characteristic white-rimmed apothecia  

**vs. *Physcia caesia***  
- *P. caesia* is more uniformly blue-gray with frosted apothecia when present  
- *P. caesia* rosettes appear cleaner and more coherent  
- Both species can have pale rims, but *P. stellaris* rims are typically whiter and more prominent

## Ecology and Notes

**Indicator Value:**  
*Physcia stellaris* favors **clean to moderately clean air** and is sensitive to pollution. It indicates relatively low levels of nitrogen and sulfur deposition, making it useful as an air-quality indicator. Its presence suggests habitats with good atmospheric circulation.

**Distribution in Minnesota:**  
Widely distributed throughout Minnesota hardwood regions. Commonly encountered on open-grown hardwoods and in lightly disturbed settings. Often forms extensive colonies on elm and maple where conditions favor growth.

**Reproductive Strategy:**  
*Physcia stellaris* reproduces primarily via **lecanorine apothecia**, which produce ascospores. Vegetative reproduction may occur through fragmentation, but sexual reproduction is the dominant strategy, distinguishing it from soredia-dependent relatives like *P. millegrana*.

**Community Context:**  
Star Rosette's distinctive white-rimmed apothecia often stand out in mixed lichen communities, making it a conspicuous and readily identified species. It frequently appears alongside brighter species like *Candelaria concolor* (Candleflame), whose yellow patches provide warm visual contrast to the cool gray rosettes. This pairing creates characteristic multi-colored bark mosaics.

**Seasonal Observations:**  
The apothecia are visible year-round and become especially prominent during periods of good moisture, when the white rims can be seen clearly even from a distance.
