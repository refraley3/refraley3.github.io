## *Xanthomendoza fallax*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Teloschistaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/teloschistaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Hooded Sunburst Lichen (*Xanthomendoza fallax*)**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/hooded-sunburst/) is a bright yellow to orange foliose lichen characterized by small, appressed rosettes and distinctive hooded or upturned lobe tips. It is part of the sunburst lichen group and is most often encountered on bark, where its saturated coloration contrasts strongly with winter substrates.

This page documents **Research Grade observations** on iNaturalist using photos [**E21A8139**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/hooded-sunburst#e21a8139) and [**E21A8141**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/hooded-sunburst#e21a8141). Visual presentation and artistic interpretation are on the [**Hooded Sunburst**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/hooded-sunburst/) in the **Gallery** section.

## Description

The thallus is **small and foliose**, forming tight rosettes typically **1–4 cm across**. Lobes are **short and narrow**, closely appressed near the center, with **distinctively hooded or slightly upturned tips** toward the margins.

The **upper surface** is vivid yellow to orange-yellow, smooth to weakly textured, and lacks soredia. Marginal features are clean and sharply defined, especially in fresh or hydrated specimens.

**Apothecia** are often present, appearing as small orange discs that blend closely with the thallus color and may be difficult to distinguish at a glance.

The **lower surface** is pale and sparsely attached, consistent with other small *Xanthomendoza* species.

## Substrate and Habitat

Observed growing on **tree bark**, frequently on hardwoods in open or lightly shaded environments. Like other members of Teloschistaceae, *Xanthomendoza fallax* favors nutrient-enriched bark and is commonly found in roadside, urban, and woodland-edge settings.

## Identification Notes

Key features supporting *Xanthomendoza fallax* include:

- Bright yellow to orange foliose rosettes  
- **Hooded or upturned lobe tips**, especially near the margins  
- Small, compact growth form  
- Lack of soredia  
- Occurrence on bark rather than rock  

It is most often confused with other small sunburst lichens, but the hooded lobe tips and compact rosette structure are especially helpful field characters.

## Similar Species

- **Bare-bottomed Sunburst (*Xanthomendoza fulva*)** — larger rosettes, broader lobes  
- **Common Sunburst (*Xanthoria parietina*)** — much larger, thicker thallus  
- **Candleflame (*Candelaria concolor*)** — powdery, sorediate, lacking defined lobes  

---

## Field Notes

These specimens were photographed under winter conditions, where moisture and low-angle light intensified coloration and emphasized lobe morphology. The hooded margins were especially apparent in close views, supporting confident identification.
