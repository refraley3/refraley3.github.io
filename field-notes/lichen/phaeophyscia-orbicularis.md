## *Phaeophyscia orbicularis*
{: .taxonomy-heading}

### Family: [Physciaceae](/field-notes/lichen/family/physciaceae/)
{: .taxonomy-heading .taxonomy-last}

[**Brown Rosette Lichen**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/) (*Phaeophyscia orbicularis*) is a small, gray-brown foliose lichen that forms tight rosettes on tree bark and other substrates. Though modest in size, it is widespread and reliable, often appearing as part of mixed bark-lichen communities where subtle color and texture differences reward close inspection.

For representative images and visual context, see the [**Mealy Shadow Lichen**](/gallery/fungi/lichen/mealy-shadow/) in the **Gallery** section.

## Description

*Phaeophyscia orbicularis* is recognized by:

- **Growth form:** foliose  
- **Thallus:** gray-brown to olive-brown, thin, closely appressed  
- **Lobes:** narrow, short, rounded to slightly elongate, often overlapping  
- **Surface features:** fine soredia common along lobe margins and surface  
- **Underside:** pale to dark brown, with simple rhizines  
- **Attachment:** firmly attached to substrate  

Colonies typically form compact rosettes, though adjacent individuals may merge into irregular patches on suitable bark.

## Substrate and Habitat

Typical substrates and settings include:
- Bark of deciduous trees (frequently hardwoods)
- Occasionally on wood or rock in urban and disturbed areas

Notes may include:
- Tolerance of open light to partial shade
- Frequent occurrence in nitrogen-enriched environments
- Often growing intermixed with other small foliose lichens

## Identification

**Key features for field diagnosis:**

- **Color:** gray-brown to olive-brown  
- **Form:** small, tight foliose rosettes  
- **Surface:** dull, often lightly pruinose, with granular soredia  
- **Underside:** brown with evident rhizines  
- **Reproductive structures:** apothecia may be present but are not always conspicuous  
- **Chemistry:** typically K−  

Commonly confused species include:
- *Physcia* species (usually with black undersides and different attachment)
- Other *Phaeophyscia* species, which may require underside and soralia details for separation

Consistency across multiple observations—particularly underside color and attachment—helps confirm identification.

## Ecology and Notes

*Phaeophyscia orbicularis* is a **nitrophilous species**, frequently associated with nutrient-rich or disturbed environments. Its presence is common in urban, suburban, and agricultural landscapes, where it contributes to diverse bark-lichen assemblages.

In Minnesota, it is widespread and regularly reaches **Research Grade** on iNaturalist, reflecting both its abundance and relative ease of confirmation with clear photographs.
