# Pine Species Comparison  
### *Austrian Pine · Jack Pine · Red Pine · Lodgepole Pine*

Pine identification can be deceptively challenging. Many species share similar silhouettes—upright trunks, paired needles, persistent cones—yet each has its own structure, texture, and “posture” in the landscape.  
This guide compares **four common or commonly planted pines** in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest:

- **Austrian Pine** (*Pinus nigra*)  
- **Jack Pine** (*Pinus banksiana*)  
- **Red Pine** (*Pinus resinosa*)  
- **Lodgepole Pine** (*Pinus contorta*, var. *latifolia*)  

Some are native, some heavily planted, some rare, and some often misidentified.  
Use this reference when sorting out pines in open meadows, windbreaks, restoration plots, or scattered plantings.

## Quick Comparison Table

### Needles

| Species | Bundles | Length | Texture & Color | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Austrian Pine** | 2 | 4–6″ | Very stiff, dark green | Needles longest and stiffest of the group; sharp to the touch. |
| **Red Pine** | 2 | 4–6″ | Flexible, glossy green | Bend-and-snap test: needle snaps cleanly when bent. |
| **Jack Pine** | 2 | 1–2″ | Short, often twisted | Classic feature: needles curve and twist irregularly. |
| **Lodgepole Pine** | 2 | 1.5–3″ | Fine, straight, bright green | Slim needles; softer and lighter than Austrian Pine. |

---

### Cones

| Species | Size & Shape | Persistence | Special Traits |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Austrian Pine** | 2–3″, oval | Drop after a few seasons | Thick, light brown scales with low prickles. |
| **Red Pine** | 1.5–2.5″, round-oval | Drop yearly | Unarmed scales; cones feel smooth. |
| **Jack Pine** | 1–2″, curved | Often very persistent | Many are **serotinous**—open with fire/heat. |
| **Lodgepole Pine** | 1–2″, egg-shaped | Persistent for many years | Many serotinous; tightly sealed until warmed by heat. |

### Bark

| Species | Young Bark | Mature Bark | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Austrian Pine** | Dark gray-brown | Thick, scaly, blocky | Never orange; stays dark and rugged. |
| **Red Pine** | Gray at base | Orange-red plates high on trunk | One of the best field marks for the species. |
| **Jack Pine** | Thin, flaky | Dark, irregular, scaly | More scruffy and uneven than other pines. |
| **Lodgepole Pine** | Thin, gray-brown | Small, scaly plates | Does not become thick or deeply furrowed. |

---

### Crown / Form

| Species | Crown Shape | Branching | Overall Look |
|--------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Austrian Pine** | Broad, rounded | Dense, heavy | Storm-resistant, muscular silhouette. |
| **Red Pine** | Tall, open, rounded | Clean lower trunks | Uniform stands common in plantations. |
| **Jack Pine** | Irregular, scraggly | Often sparse | Looks “messy,” especially in poor soils. |
| **Lodgepole Pine** | Narrow, upright | Evenly spaced | Noticeably slender; western “mountain pine” look. |

### Habitat & Origin

| Species | Native Range | Midwest Presence | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **Austrian Pine** | Europe | Widely planted | Brought by settlers; hardy but disease-prone today. |
| **Red Pine** | Upper Great Lakes | Native, common | Minnesota’s state tree; extensive reforestations. |
| **Jack Pine** | Great Lakes, Canada | Native, common locally | Thrives on dry, sandy soils; key in fire ecosystems. |
| **Lodgepole Pine** | Rockies, Pacific NW | Occasionally planted | Not native; appears in research and restoration plots. |

## Field Recognition Tips

### Austrian Pine
- Longest, stiffest needles  
- Very dark, heavy crown  
- Trunk bark stays dark and blocky  
- Common in windbreaks and old farm plantings  

### Red Pine
- Needles flexible, bright green  
- “Bend-and-snap” test is reliable  
- Bark turns orange high on trunk  
- Uniform plantations are common  

### Jack Pine
- Short, twisted needles  
- Small, curved serotinous cones  
- Irregular, scruffy crown  
- Common in dry sand plains  

### Lodgepole Pine
- Very narrow young form  
- Fine, straight needles  
- Layers of persistent cones  
- Looks “western” compared to Midwest pines
