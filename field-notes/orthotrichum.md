## Mixed Bryophyte–Lichen Community

Bryophytes are a collection of plants, mosses, liverworts and hornworts. There are three distinct phyla: Hepotophyta, Anthocerophyta, and Byrophyta.

Bright yellow foliose lichen clusters drift across the surface like small islands of color, while dark tufted mosses and pale gray crustose species weave between the fissures of the bark. Together, they form a miniature hillside of textures—soft, bristled, curled, and powdered—each shaped by moisture, sun, and the bark’s slow weathering.

### Possible Identification (similarity):

- Cratoneuron filicinum
 - **Kneiff's Hook-Moss** (Drepanocladus aduncus)

- **Long-leaved Thread Moss** (Ptychostomum pseudotriquitrum)
- (Amblystegium serpens mod. juratzkanum)

- **Ribbed Bog Moss** (Aulacomnium palustre)
- **Smooth-stalk Feather-Moss** (Brachythecium salebrosum)
 - **Yellow Starry Fen Moss** (Campylium stellatum)
 - **Waterside Feather Moss** (Brachythecium rivulare)
- Elegant Bristle-Moss (Orthotrichum pulchellum), Germany  
- Starry Bristle Moss (Orthotricum stellatum)  
- White-tipped Bristle-Moss (Orthotrichum diapharnum)  
- (Orthotrichum ohioense)

## Photos

The primary image, **Softfield Scatter**, brings attention to how these communities assemble themselves around bark ridges.  
Yellow foliose lobes settle into pockets of rough bark while moss filaments climb vertically, contrasting sharply with the brittle gray crusts around them. The small tuft moss in the scene is likely an **Orthotrichum** species—one of the most common bark mosses in Minnesota—while the yellow patches resemble early-stage foliose growth of a **sunburst-type** lichen.

## Identification

### **Tuft Moss (Orthotrichum sp.)**
- Dense, upright, bristly clumps.  
- Common on **elm, oak, and maple bark**.  
- Leaves aligned tightly around the stem, giving a “bottlebrush” appearance.

---

## Habitat

These communities thrive on **older, rough bark** where differing textures provide:

- Moisture pockets  
- Sunlit ridges  
- Shaded crevices  
- Stable surfaces for spore settlement  
- Micro-shelters for moss protonema and lichen photobionts

This type of mixed assemblage is typical on elm trunks in **Minnesota hardwood forests**, especially in partial sun where yellow foliose lichens intensify in color.

## Notes

The moss in this photograph is tentatively identified as **Orthotrichum**, a genus known for its tufted, upright growth on bark.  
Though small in size compared to the yellow foliose patches, it contributes significant structural diversity to the scene—adding a vertical element to contrast with the lichen’s flat lobes.
